  <title>They’Re with You Win or Tie - Dr. Harold C. Carl Ii, Dr. H. William Mitchell, Catherine Victoria Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hilarious stories youd never dream could emerge from the office of a superintendent of school!  This book demonstrates that a good sense of humor is probably more important that possessing a PhD in dealing with the diversified spectrum of visitors who cross the superintendents threshold on a daily basis  all with a problem that  only he can solve!  Youve got to deal with them all  from the governors office and the state superintendent of schools to the least affluent and unemployed.  How you do this, and making them all feel special in the process  - dictates your measure of success and tenure in office.  Also, that little bit of humor  you inject into the seemingly most serious of cases, especially to the persons involved, may go a long way in diffusing some volatile situations and putting them into a workable perspective which then become  win-win for all concerned.
	This book also contains many valuable gems of wisdom in dealing with work related eventualities from some of the worlds wisest minds  - such as Dr. Norman Vincent  Peale.  Also some of Americas top executives provide inspirational themes which illustrate how they became top level CEOs" />
