  <title>An Administrative Compendium on Trends for Identifying Adequate Blood Donation by African Americans - Bruce M. Williams Ms Ms Hca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The blood collection business was chosen because the arena is central to any effort to save lives with blood and blood products. The field needs improvement and innovation. There is not a lot of data on this sector of the business community. This is not a comparison of the private sector of the business community and the nonprofit sector. Earnings are at the top of the list of the foremost concerns. The type of workers is at issue as well. Many of the nonprofit health-care employees were post graduate females. The nature of the work performed is important. The employees motivation is also a factor worth considering. Whether the job was full time or part time did make a difference in nonprofit employee characteristics. 
Participants have several obstacles that prevent them from donating blood. They have a few motivators for donating blood. Because the needed matching blood types are in the African American community this does not mean that they should know that given the distant behavior of the blood collecting business to the African American Community. The Scientific method of observation, measurement and documentation, theory and test the theory is used. In each paper the synthesis method is used to structure the data and information. The Sickle cell model will be used herein." />
