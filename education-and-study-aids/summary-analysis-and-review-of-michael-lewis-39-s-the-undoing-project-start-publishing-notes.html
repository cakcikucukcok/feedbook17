  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Michael Lewis&#39;s The Undoing Project - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Michael Lewis&#39;s The Undoing Project:A Friendship that Changed Our Minds includes a summary of the book, Review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Michael Lewis, the author of the successful book-turned-movie Moneyball, found inspiration for his new book in a review by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. Writing in The New Republic, Thaler and Sunstein argued that the ideas in Moneyball were not original. Rather, Moneyball was a good illustration of ideas that had originated from two Israeli psychologists named Daniel (Danny) Kahenam and Amos Tversky. Lewis had never heard these names before and he was intrigued. 
Lewis then introduces readers to our main protagonists, Danny and Amos. First, Lewis discusses Danny Kahenman. Danny had survived World War II, partly by evading concentration camps and moving to Israel had taught him that people were very strange. His interest in psychology was as a means to study philosophy. He wanted to understand the world through understanding the people who lived in it. Why, for example, when there is a regime that has as its goal the extermination of Jews, do some Jewish people recognize the threat and escape, while others remain and die?" />
