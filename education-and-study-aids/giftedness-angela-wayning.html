  <title>Giftedness - Angela Wayning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are 4 books in this book bundle, consisting of the topics below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 1: Where do you go if your child is gifted? Should you do anything differently? This question lies at the heart of this book, as well as other sub-topics that relate to it. Your knowledge will increase about giftedness, and solutions will be provided for a problematic child who is looking for the right therapist. Someone with an expert opinion and degree in psychology could definitely be beneficial to your child&amp;rsquo;s development. In this book, we&amp;rsquo;ll break down what to look for in a therapist like that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 2: Gifted children are typically a bit more advanced in their thinking, but they still need to be taught how to apply that intelligence towards practical goals. This is where problem-solving skills come in. This book devotes at least one chapter to that topic.&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the book, we&amp;rsquo;ll take you to the most common things to look for in schools, and several programs that help gifted children grow faster academically, so they can reach their full potential.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 3: Do gifted children have behavioral problems? Do they adapt? Are they perfectionists? The answer to these three questions is a resounding &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo; However, this also raises questions that need to be answered about how to parent them, how to handle outbursts and emotional moments, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Book 4: Many parents wonder about their gifted children. They wonder where their intelligence came from, or why they behave the way they do. For example, many gifted children can be bossy or act as if they are adults, with their wits and words, while still showing immature behavior of a 4-year-old, or whatever their age is. This puzzles parents, and answers need to be given." />
