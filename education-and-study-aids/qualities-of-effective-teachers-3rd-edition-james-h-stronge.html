  <title>Qualities of Effective Teachers, 3rd Edition - James H. Stronge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every teacher seeks to be an &lt;em&gt;effective&lt;/em&gt; teacher. Every teacher wants to have a positive, remarkable, and lasting influence on students&#39; lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what makes for an effective teacher? What role does teacher preparation play in teacher effectiveness? What do effective teachers do during planning, instruction, and assessment? How do they create a learning environment that engages and supports students? And how do effective teachers interact with their students to promote the best opportunities and results for all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Qualities of Effective Teachers&lt;/em&gt;, 3rd edition, James H. Stronge explores these questions and more as he synthesizes the literature on teacher effectiveness. The result? A research-based framework for effective teaching that addresses:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Professional knowledge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instructional planning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instructional delivery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assessment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Professionalism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronge also examines characteristics of effective teachers of at-risk students and high-ability students. To bridge the gap between research and practice, he includes checklists of skills and positive qualities associated with effective teacher performance as well as red flags that indicate that teachers may not be reaching their full potential in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resource is for any educator interested in improving teaching. It offers research-based advice for teachers who wish to improve their own performance, as well guidance for teacher leaders and supervisors, school administrators and department heads, staff development specialists, teacher and administrator educators, human resource specialists, and education policymakers and their staffs. Anyone who has a vested interest in students and their success can gain valuable insight and practical tools to ensure positive outcomes for all students.&lt;/p&gt;
