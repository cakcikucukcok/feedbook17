  <title>You Are More Than You Think - Emmanuel Igwe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Opening Proverb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an African proverb that says, &quot;A cockroach knows how to sing and dance, but it is the hen that prevents it from performing its art during the day.&quot; What does this mean? Well, in many African villages it is not uncommon to see a hungry hen running around pecking at the ground for its meal of cockroaches scurrying about. But, without the hindrance of its enemy, the hen, the cockroach would be free to demonstrate all that its skilled to do. My question is if cockroaches can dance in the face of danger, why cant you? What hen, giant, king or obstacle is holding you from being all that youre created for? Why did you stop using your God given talents and gifts in the service of his kingdom? Who has turned you against yourself, emasculated you and frozen your potentials? Now is the time to declare to that mountain to be removed and be cast into the sea (Matt 17:20); To that tumultuous and raging situation, peace be still (Mark 4:39) to that giant &quot; I am well able to overcome you (Numbers 13:30); to that king Nebuchadnezzar terrorizing your life &quot;My God is able to deliver me (Daniel 3:17) and to that circumstance, like Jesus &quot;I will rise again (Matt 27:63) For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD (PSALM 27:5- 6). If cockroaches can dance in the face of its enemy, I can too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible gifts and talents are not just given to some but to all. We are called to use those gifts in service of others. They are instruments and tools that help build the kingdom of God on earth. According to Bishop T D Jakes, senior pastor of the Potters House, the gift, talent, and abilities God gave you is your key to success. They were not given to you to be put on display, to be wasted, to be hidden or denied out of a false sense of religious humility but, to be poured out, to be used and invested. Apostle Paul in the book of Romans succinctly admonishes us in these words, &quot;Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness&quot; (Roman 12:6-8 New King James Version). Do not forget that God does not give equal gifts or talents but equal opportunity for investment; we dont have equal gifts and talents but the same twenty-four hours in a day to utilize it, and there is the enemy, like the hen, walking about, seeking to devour those who would dare use their gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. (1 Peter 5:8, NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this proverb, if singing and dancing represent the gifts that are given by God to every person, then we all can &quot;sing and dance&quot; Hence the Bible declared that He gave gifts to all men. To my greatest chagrin, there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of singing and dancing going on! Why? What hen do you think is trying to devour you and your gift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter in this book is dedicated to a &quot;hen&quot; that may be keeping you from singing and dancing, performing your art, or becoming all that God created you to be. Well call them &quot;hen-drances.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the foundation of the earth God wrote history, and it is known as &quot;His-story&quot; because only God, His son and His Spirit can give an accurate account and story of my life. In His-story, He included you, me, and every other person throughout all of time. Do you see why everyone else that attempts to tell your story becomes" />
