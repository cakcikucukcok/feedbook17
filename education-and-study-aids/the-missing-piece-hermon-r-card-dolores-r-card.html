  <title>The Missing Piece - Hermon R. Card, Dolores R. Card</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are in an education crisis. We need to restore the teaching profession to one of respect and support and provide effective education to enable current students, the new kids, to rise to their full potential&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fabulous book. Herm and Dolores have written a truly inspirational resource for teachers. This should be required reading for anyone preparing to enter the classroomand for anyone who needs to step back and rethink, think through, or reconsider their practice. They speak to the readers heart as well as the head, and Herms poetry is the best medicine I know for preventing teacher burnout.&lt;br /&gt;
Carol Jago, president of the National Council of Teachers of English and long-time middle and high school teacher in Santa Monica, California&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Missing Piece by Dolores and Hermon Card is the book weve all been waiting for about how to educate the new kids, this evolutionary bunch of uniquely different individuals known variously by labels as quirky as they are. You name it and this book covers it, and in a style as usable as it is advanced. Dolores and Hermon encourage students to make connections to themselves and then work beyond themselves to extend their reachto work with us, not for us. &lt;br /&gt;
The raw truth about our current education system and how to fix it is covered, with poetry, with solutions and with expansive teaching styles that include meditation, Reiki, chakras, the higher self, and the importance of spirituality. No, this isnt new age; it is new thought, in its most courageous forma balanced and realistic way to educate the whole child.&lt;br /&gt;
I was blown away by The Missing Piece. No one else has looked at our educational system today, and the various proposals to fix whats wrong, with eyes and hearts broad enough to recognize what was and is still missing, what the new kids must havea holistic approach. Thank you, Dolores and Hermon Card, for giving us a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;
