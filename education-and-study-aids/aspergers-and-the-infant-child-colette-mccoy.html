  <title>Aspergers and the Infant Child - Colette McCoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;...I did not want to see problems where there werent any, because I was more aware of aspergers than the average parent. Also, teaching children with special needs is quite different than accepting that your beautiful daughter has such needs- a label just makes it all sound so final...&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Aspergers is a hidden disability; as it is not a physical disability it does not register automatic understanding. It is a series of developmental disorders known as The Triad of Impairment, including: communication, social interaction and inflexible thought/imagination. My child is aspergers, she does not have aspergers- it is not an infectious disease; there is nothing wrong with her- she merely has different needs. A label has a tendency to emphasize the negative, not the positive and the person.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book details Elizabeths journey (and that of many families) but also provides valuable information for all families of children touched by aspergers. I have found many aspergers books to be of a clinical nature and not accessible to parents who have just been given a diagnosis; often without subsequent advice and support. In my experience, a diagnosis can be like someone has thrown a grenade at you and is then running away- you are left to deal with the fall-out!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hopefully, this book is accessible to all and will help people- it has certainly helped me and when Elizabeth is older, I hope it will explain a few things to her. I also hope that it will enlighten professionals who work with her (and others like her.) My point is that I am the closest person to my daughter and I dont fully know or understand her. How can they? I honestly don&#39;t expect them to do so; I do expect them to have an awareness of the condition and to understand that a child who is aspergers has particular needs, even if they are not always apparent.&lt;/P&gt;" />
