  <title>Summary, Analysis, and Review of Jen Hatmaker’s Of Mess and Moxie - Start Publishing Notes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PLEASE NOTE: This is a key takeaways and analysis of the book and NOT the original book. 
Start Publishing Notes’ Summary, Analysis, and Review of Jen Hatmaker’s Of Mess and Moxie: Wrangling Delight Out of This Wild and Glorious Life includes a summary of the book, a review, analysis &amp; key takeaways, and a detailed “About the Author” section. 
PREVIEW: Of Mess and Moxie: Wrangling Delight Out of This Wild and Glorious Life is a collection of nonfiction essays and life advice by the bestselling Christian humorist Jen Hatmaker. Sharing a selection of her personal ups and downs from childhood through the present day, Hatmaker reflects on what it means to lead a full and happy life as a modern woman. 
The titular “mess” and “moxie” are two universal experiences that all women share. The mess is the chaos, confusion, and pain that comes standard issue in life. Mess is unavoidable; every woman deals with heartbreak and failure in her life on some level. What keeps them going is their moxie—that special spark that’s unique to women. The balance that’s important to achieve is to not get so bogged down in the mess that you lose touch with the moxie." />
