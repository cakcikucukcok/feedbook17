        Life can be unfair at times. It appears so can working at a university.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Our universities are unfortunately a microcosm of our larger society. They mirror what occurs in the real world. As such they are prone to the same
        societal and personal frailties that plague the rest of America and its working force.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        While a universitys mission, vision, and goals may espouse loftier ambitions, in the end, it must deal with an imperfect system that often prevents it
        from achieving those ideals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Whats Hiding Behind Those Ivy Covered Walls? An Expose On Americas Universities takes a closer look at these schools from a different perspective,
        that of an insider who has spent decades plodding through the back corridors of many such institutions in an attempt to make a difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It unveils the often harsh realities of campus life for those who have chosen to work at these schools. It discusses campus culture, tradition, and
        politics. It examines who is hired and why. It explores both the formal and informal bureaucratic hierarchy. It speaks to the leadership within these
        schools as well as strategies employed to gain professional and personal influence and power. It offers a better understanding of the perspective of
        those who work there. It also delves into the intricacies of survival and the promises of advancement. In the end, it provides a candid, unvarnished,
        and honest look at just what is really occurring on our nations campuses.
