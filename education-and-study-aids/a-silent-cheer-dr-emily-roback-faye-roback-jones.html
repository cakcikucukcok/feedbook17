  <title>A Silent Cheer - Dr. Emily Roback, Faye Roback-Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hearing is one of our most precious senses. It allows us to communicate with family and friends and keeps us in contact with the sounds of life that surround us twenty-four hours a day. Unfortunately, most of us dont realize how important this sense is until hearing problems begin to affect our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In A Silent Cheer&lt;/i&gt;, Dr. Emily F. Roback and her mother, Faye D. Roback-Jones, provide an insiders look at deaf culture, demonstrating how parents of a hearing-impaired or deaf child can learn the ropes of determination, and how every day tens of thousands of Canadians with disabilities continue to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir follows the Robacks journey from Emilys diagnosis with severe to profound hearing loss when she was three years old. A Silent Cheer tells Emilys inspirational story of facing often overwhelming adversities to achieving success as a doctor of chiropractic medicine, a renowned fitness leader in western Canada, and the president of her own company. In addition, Faye reveals the strategies she used to help her daughters transformation from strawberry farm girl to doctor, including the challenges she overcame to ensure Emily received the same quality education as her peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive and uplifting, A Silent Cheer addresses the dedication, passion, and character necessary to survive and thrive in spite of the odds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
