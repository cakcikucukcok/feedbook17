  <title>The Making of an Urban Community College in a Union and Political Environment: - Dr. Willie J. Greer Kimmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The manuscript will carefully discuss the beginning and turbulent struggle of Wayne County Community College in the 60s; the middle years of growth and pain of the 70s; the crisis of the 80s that almost closed the college; the growth in the 90s; and its current status of productivity and stability. In addition, the book will address community and instructional leaders roles, duties, responsibilities, and styles. Their commitments and obligations in the teaching, learning, and leadership development process will also be addressed. The document will demonstrate how to plan, how to develop your own leadership style, and how to inspire leadership in others. This body of work is an outgrowth of many years of discussions between citizens of Detroit; former students, teachers, and staff; political and community leaders; and the board of trustees and former presidents of Wayne County Community College in Detroit, Michigan, whom I owe a tremendous amount of admiration, respect, and appreciation too." />
