      <meta name="description" content="Rhinehearts Game: Mission Two
NJ Farnsworth is a ten-year-old in the fourth grade.  He is the fourth of six children in his familyand he was born with spina bifida.  Until this year, NJ hated school and merely endured every day in his wheelchair.  But when his school gave him a laptop computer for his homework, he discovered a secret virtual reality program in which he can walk and run and play like other children.  On each level of the game, NJ learns principles, values and skills to help him live better in his wheelchair.  This mission requires that he save the lives of three people before he can complete the level successfully.  But who does he have to save?  What must he save them from?  How can he save anyone else, when he is just ten years old?  Will he even be able to save himself inside this level of Rhinehearts Game?" />
