  <title>Triumph - Beatriz Martinez-Peñalver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The use of antidepressants has increased by 400% since 1988, and at least one out of every three Americans is dissatisfied with life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite those sobering statistics, we are not doing enough to teach children how to become emotionally literate. Our education is incomplete. There are multiple curriculums in the school systems for math, science, language arts, social studies; however, not one complete curriculum for emotional literacy.  We&#39;re failing to carry out one of our main duties: preparing the next generation to enjoy a life filled with joy and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beatriz Martinez-Pealver, a psychotherapist with more than twenty-five years of experience, seeks to fix that problem with this fluid curriculum that helps students, educators, and parents live a life without limits. Learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&amp;#149develop thought patterns that lead to Triumph;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149Challenge erroneous thoughts given to them by parents, teachers and society.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149see failure as an integral part of success;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149substitute negative thoughts with empowering affirmations; &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149become a problem solver individual;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149experience silence to create a life worth living.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get the practical guidance and strategies you need to help students overcome challenges, and inspire them to create the phenomenal life they are meant to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endorsement by the CEO of Susan Jeffers, LLC:&lt;/p&gt;  It was my wife&#39;s, Susan Jeffers, Ph.D., dream to create a book for children and adolescents based on the teaching in her landmark self-help book, Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway. Inspired by Susan&#39;s work, Beatriz has developed a curriculum that I believe will be required teaching in all schools.Her concise curriculum will help the future generations of our children to:&lt;/p&gt; 
&amp;#149Be free of anxieties, &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149Challenge erroneous thoughts given to them by parents, teachers and society, &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149Develop plans to reach their individual success by becoming self-reliant individuals, and &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&amp;#149Learn to tap into their unlimited creative potential and much more. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The steps taught on this curriculum will help any student become the successful and extraordinary people they deserve to be.&lt;/P&gt;
