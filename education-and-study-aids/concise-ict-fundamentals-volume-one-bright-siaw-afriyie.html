  <title>Concise Ict Fundamentals Volume One - Bright Siaw Afriyie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Knowing that this world is now moving toward a global villagewe are in information era where practically nothing can be done without the power of computers in most industries. A solid knowledge about fundamentals of computing has become indispensable in everyday life. This book has been prepared for you to uncover several confusing concepts that pose a big challenge to computer learners and users. I am coming from both educational and professional background with great experience to better alienate the hinges that serve as obstacles to high-tech solutions to everyone. It is the togetherness of a great practical experience, educational and teaching skills, technical know-how, and continuous customer value-added service and research that has always been the source of creation of this book and three other computer science books. The feedbacks so far received from few professors in information technology in Dallas, Texas, area strongly suggests the use of these books as a great fundamental and companion material for computer science students. In Ghana, the Education Service and Curriculum Research and Development Department (CRDD) has approved the Concise ICT Fundamentals textbook as the recommended supplementary material for the teaching and learning of ICT in senior high schools, technical schools, and colleges of education and for general usage. 
The organization of the core material in this book both provides support training unconditionally to everyone who wants to be computer literate and also extends its learning curve to high quality ICT systems engineering to individuals or companies already operational in the high-tech industry. This book provides a solid foundation for information technology. This book is essentially prepared for senior high school and first year college students. You dont want to miss this good news." />
