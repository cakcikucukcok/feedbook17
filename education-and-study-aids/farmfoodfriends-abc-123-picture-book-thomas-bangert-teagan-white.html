      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Recognizing letters and numbers is the most important pre-school skill parents and families can help children learn. FarmFoodFRIENDS ABC-123 Picture Book features 26 beautifully illustrated watercolor farm scenes that help everyone learn the alphabet, numbers, vocabulary, writing, and where food comes from on a farm! OneBillionSEEDS is an education company with a global vision of teaching and facilitating language development through food. We have created a platform for parents and teachers to help their children learn fundamental language that promotes literacy and imagination through food, and the understanding of where food comes from on a farm. Our group of original characters is called the Farm Food Friends, consisting of an equal amount of boy and girl farm food characters. The characters live on a farm that is designed with a polyculture and permaculture structure...they benefit each other, and each have a positive personality trait that can be reflected upon and talked about for years to come. OneBillionSEEDS promotes a simple paradigm called GPS... GROW PREPARE SHARE. We want children to learn to GROW their own food, PREPARE their own meals, and SHARE what they create!&lt;/p&gt;" />
