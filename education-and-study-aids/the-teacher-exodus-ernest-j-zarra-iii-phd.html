  <title>The Teacher Exodus - Ernest J. Zarra Iii PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Teacher Exodus: Reversing the Trend and Keeping Teachers in the Classrooms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is an authentic examination of many of the reasons public school teachers are leaving the profession. It also takes a hard look at why students are no longer selecting teaching as their career choice. American culture is at a tipping point and many politicians and bureaucrats are tinkering with culture through racial policies and social engineering, in efforts to empower students, rather than stem the tide of teacher attrition. Teachers are frustrated by requirements to implement social and intervention programs that fall outside their training, which limits the moral purpose they envisioned when they first entered the profession. Across the nation, teachers are feeling marginalized and impacted by policies handed down from above, which actually elevate students over teachers. Teachers sense their profession has been reduced to classroom monitoring and facilitating, which they did not sign up for! They are restricted in their classroom management and must employ a series of intervention strategies just to defend their actions of discipline. If America is to reverse the trend of teachers leaving classrooms, there must be genuinely supportive efforts to reinvigorate adults to pursue teaching and bureaucrats must release teachers to work their skills. There must be a reversal of the mindset that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;teachers are leaving education because education has left them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. One way to do this is for bureaucrats and education administrators to once again empower teachers to be the local arbiters of education for their classrooms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
