  <title>The Teacher&#39;s Innovation Workbook - Leah Wasburn-Moses</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Have an idea to change your classroom? Your school? The school system?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This workbook is a practical guide to innovation aimed at supporting practicing educators and school administrators. It walks educators from idea generation through planning, problem-solving, implementation, evaluation, and growth and development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefit of this workbook is that it can be seen as an antidote to the pressures felt by teachers almost universally in today&amp;rsquo;s schools. It provides educators with a means to push back, to create and innovate despite the many challenges in their workplaces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This research-based tool supports teacher professionalism and complements professional development plans. It provides seven concrete steps with accompanying blank worksheets as well as four complete diverse examples to guide readers&amp;rsquo; work. Practical organization, careful planning, and thorough evaluation are emphasized throughout. In sum, the workbook allows teachers to rediscover why they entered the profession in the first place &amp;ndash; to make a difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
