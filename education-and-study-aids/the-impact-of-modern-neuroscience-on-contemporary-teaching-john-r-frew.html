  <title>The Impact of Modern Neuroscience on Contemporary Teaching - John R Frew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the 1990s, there has been an explosion in the awareness of the impact of the development and function of the brain on schooling. The availability of techniques like magnetic resonance imaging allows scientists to examine how the brain functions with increasing accuracy; it is at the core of neuroscience and, increasingly, psychiatry. The results have allowed educators to improve their approach to teaching and learning, but these ideas habitually clash with the traditional structure of educational theory, which is underpinned by cognitive practices.
This new information can assist teachers in dealing not only with a students learning but also in understanding the causes of severely dysfunctional behavior and techniques for managing behaviors that impact on the learning of individuals and their peers." />
