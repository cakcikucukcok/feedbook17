  <title>The Male Teenager&#39;s 9 Late Signs of Alcoholism - Becki Bateman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alcoholism is the only disease known to man in which the longer you have it, the more it convinces you that you do not. Its stereotype is such that most people do not recognize it until it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking to help address the disease in male teens, The Male Teenagers Nine Late Signs of Alcoholism presents the third and final volume in the ALERT (Actual Learning Examples of Recognizing Trouble) series, written by Becki Bateman with Dave Payne. This informative, easy-to-read guide provides examples that can help teens determine whether they might have a serious drinking problem, offering a detailed explanation of the signs of late stage alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series seeks to guide male teenagers through recognizing all three stages of alcoholism and assisting them in determining if they need help. Teens have a tough time accepting the fact that they might be alcoholics, especially teenage boys; whats more, even if they realize they have a problem with alcohol, they often dont know where to turn to get the help. This guide provides critical information such as everyday situations that might indicate problems and resources for teens looking for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ALERT seriesaimed not only at teens but also at their parents, friends, relatives, or anyone who may have a problem with alcoholcan get teens the help they need before its too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
