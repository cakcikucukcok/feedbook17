  <title>Dust in the Wind - C. Nick Potcovaru</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been in the making for about twenty years now,
although it only took a bit over a year to write it; in one form or
another it had always coexisted with my daily thoughts, never
letting me forget that it was there, just waiting for the right time to
be incarnated.
That time, that right time is now. After a very long time, and
through adversities too many to enumerate, against all odds, I am
finally able to bring you the book. This is the first volume in a trilogy
I call Dust in the Wind. Book two entitled In Exile and book
three entitled Coming to America will follow soon. Although this
book is a work of fiction, it is based on real events that took place
in Romania between December 1989 and July 1990. This book is
a tribute to the heroes who sacrificed their lives in December 1989,
because they believed in freedom, democracy, and the triumph of
the human spirit, to the . . . oh so many . . . their number as of yet
still unknown, victims of the events of 13-15 of June, 1990, to the
countless ordinary people who never had a fair shake, to the ones
left behind, but never forgotten." />
