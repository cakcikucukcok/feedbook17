The ambiance of the time, the feeling that an era is coming to an end and the uncertainty that goes with it, resonates deeply.<br /><b><i>Kowloon Tong by Paul Theroux - Goodreads</i></b> | Paul Theroux is a wonderful travel writer; too bad he did not stick to that genre. Kowloon Tong is a poor book--poorly written, poorly plotted--poor characters. The stereotyping of English people living in Hong Kong is almost too much to even talk about.<br /><b><i>Kowloon Tong: A Novel of Hong Kong: Theroux, Paul ...</i></b> | Kowloon Tong (1997) is a novel by Paul Theroux about Neville "Bunt" Mullard, an English mummy's boy born and raised in Hong Kong. The story is set in the days leading up to the handover to China of Hong Kong from the British.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Kowloon Tong - Paul Theroux</a> </h3></p><hr/>
