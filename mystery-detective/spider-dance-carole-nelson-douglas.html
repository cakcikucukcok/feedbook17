  <title>Spider Dance - Carole Nelson Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opera singer. Adventuress. American abroad. Irene Adler is all of this...and is also the only woman to ever have outwitted the great man, Sherlock Holmes. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Carole Nelson Douglas&#39;s novel &lt;i&gt;Spider Dance&lt;/i&gt;, Irene has finally come home after numerous adventures, not out of loyalty to her native shores but because of a baffling puzzle, and the one thing that haunts her. Irene has no real memory of her childhood and has spent most of her life creating a persona to fit her passions. When Daredevil reporter Nelly Bly lures Irene to America by hinting that she knows of Irene&#39;s parentage, Irene takes the bait and in doing so, embarks upon a pursuit of the most notorious woman of the nineteenth century. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before the intrigue-ridden quest is over, Irene will uncover murderous international political conspiracies, lost treasure, and finally . . . the full, shocking secret of her birth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
