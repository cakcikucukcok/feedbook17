  <title>Fathom - Dave Moruzzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fathom is a slight departure from the first five Ben Bass Mysteries.  This tale finds Captain Bass sailing in Western Caribbean waters in one of Windward Islands Bare Boats&#39; thirty-seven foot sloops.  It is also a factual look at the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and a review of the resulting, disastrous air battle.  The real aerial combat that pitted modified WWII B-26 Marauders against Castro&#39;s high-speed, piston- and jet-engine fighters is covered, the losses are memorialized and a possible unintended outcome is added.  The reader is taken back to those fateful days in 1961 when the world watched as a few thousand counterrevolutionaries struggled unsuccessfully to thwart the Fidel Castro&#39;s communist takeover of Cuba.  These events are reviewed while an imagined outcome provides modern-day events in the Caribbean Sea.  A leased sailboat is rammed and sunk, the ultimate fate of the crew is investigated, and Captain Ben Bass finds himself in the middle of another adventure." />
