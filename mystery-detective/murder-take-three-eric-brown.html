  <title>Murder Take Three - Eric Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1950s Private Investigator Donald Langham discovers that truth is stranger than fiction when he investigates a murder on an American movie set. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1956. Having just started work as a professional private investigator, Donald Langham’s first client is American movie star Suzie Reynard, currently shooting a murder mystery film at Marling Hall, an Elizabethan manor house in the depths of the Norfolk countryside. The film’s director – Suzie’s lover – has been receiving threats and Suzie is convinced his life is in danger. 
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
On arriving at Marling Hall with his fiancée Maria, Langham finds the film set awash with clashing egos, petty jealousies, ill-advised love affairs and seething resentments. Matters come to a head when a body is discovered in the director’s trailer.
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
It would appear to be an open-and-shut case when someone confesses to the murder.  Donald and Maria are not convinced – but why would someone confess to a crime they haven’t committed? If Langham is to uncover the truth, he must delve into the past and another murder that took place more than twenty years before…" />
