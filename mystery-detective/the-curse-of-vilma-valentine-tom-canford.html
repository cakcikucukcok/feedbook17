  <title>The Curse of Vilma Valentine - Tom Canford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adored by some, abhorred by others, actress Vilma Valentine is presumed dead after a fiery automobile collision in Mexico, her body never recovered. In the intervening years the fabled star is sighted more often than Bigfoot. Is it her ghost that crashes a party for Ronald Reagan in Juarez, appears at the deathbed of her estranged father in Rome, flees from Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst at the Parthenon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
In 1969 Virginia Dofstader wins the Valentine lookalike contest publicizing &lt;I&gt;The Curse of Vilma Valentine&lt;/I&gt; by literary heavyweight Gerald Carstairs. In the course of the book&#39;s promotion, it is discovered that Virginia&#39;s mother looks even more like Vilma than Miss Dofstader does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
As notorious in death as in life, Vilma haunts the imagination of aficionados of 1940 movies. Did she really kill all those husbands? Was she a Nazi spy? Was she truly responsible for the bombing of Pearl Harbor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Her story, a suspenseful stew of WWII saboteurs, stolen European artworks, murders and massacres, is told in the words of major Hollywood figures-lovers, friends, enemies, and Vilma herself. It&#39;s all seasoned with a knowing dose of romantic comedy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
