  <title>A Bali Conspiracy Most Foul - Shamini Flint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Bali, where violence, intrigue, and infidelity are all part of a day&#39;s work for Inspector Singh.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspector Singh, everyone&#39;s favorite portly and wheezing homicide detective, is still recovering from his last case when terrorists set off a bomb on the neighboring island of Bali. With Singapore&#39;s anti-terrorist team busy defending the home front, Inspector Singh&#39;s bosses ship him to Bali to assist with the investigation. Unfortunately, Inspector Singh has as much experience with terrorism as he does with proper diet and exercise - &lt;i&gt;none.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the police find a skull fragment of a man who was killed &lt;i&gt;before &lt;/i&gt;the bomb went off, Inspector Singh is assigned to the case. With Bronwyn Taylor, a peppy and eternally optimistic Australian cop, at his side, Singh&#39;s investigation leads him to the wife of the murdered man, and her group of entitled, expatriate friends. The murder seems like an open-and-shut case - that is, until Bronwyn and Singh realize that this crowd is riddled with enough cheating and discontent to fill out a soap opera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple murder is quickly becoming more complicated than Singh could have imagined. And how does it all tie into the act of terrorism that brought him to Bali in the first place? Set in an exotic locale and starring an unforgettable cast of characters, this second mystery featuring the utterly lovable Inspector Singh is exciting, funny, and suspenseful, with an ending that even the most seasoned detective couldn&#39;t predict.&lt;/p&gt;" />
