  <title>Diamond In the Rough - Annetta Swift</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victoria Robinson was once a picture of perfection, &quot;Beauty and Brains&quot; would be an understatement in describing her.  However, she swiftly went from rags to riches and back to rags. Her world seemed unshakable at one point and quickly took a downward spiral into a place that she never thought she would be.  Her dark side surfaced and she found herself caught up in a series of events that would question her lifestyle, innocence of murder, illegal dealings and the list goes on.  Will she ever find her way back to the top?  How can she erase the past that haunts her daily?  Is she guilty of murder or was she set up? These questions will be answered and by the story&#39;s end everyone will recognize that we all, in one phase of our lives or another, were a DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH." />
