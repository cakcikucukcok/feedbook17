  <title>Lie in Plain Sight - Maggie Barbieri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a busy day at the bakery Maeve Conlon owns when she receives a phone call from the high school saying Maeve&#39;s employee&#39;s daughter, Taylor Dvorak, is ill. Taylor&#39;s mom is out on a delivery and Taylor has her own car, so harried Maeve gives the school nurse permission to send Taylor home on her own. But Taylor never makes it: Somewhere between the school and her house, she just vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does Maeve feel responsible, but she can&#39;t shake the feeling that there&#39;s more to Taylor&#39;s disappearance than meets the eye. So Maeve decides to take matters into her own capable hands. She finds that Farringville has a lot more to hide than most small towns, from the secretive high school girls&#39; soccer coach to Taylor&#39;s estranged father and her troubled mother, and she gets to work shining a light on all these mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancing this dark undertaking and her relationship with a local policeman, Maeve will have to walk the fine line between justice and revenge carefully if she hopes to prevail in the next suspenseful novel from Maggie Barbieri.&lt;/p&gt;" />
