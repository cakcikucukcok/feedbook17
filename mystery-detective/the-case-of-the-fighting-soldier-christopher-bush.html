  <title>The Case of the Fighting Soldier - Christopher Bush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was I to be this time? A Commandant again of a Prisoner of War Camp? Was I to get a sedentary job at the War Office itself, and begin the slow process of fossilisation? Was I due for some wholly new job of which the rank and file had never even heard? As it turned out, I most certainly was.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ludovic Travers reports to room 299 of the War Office to receive new orders. He is sent up to Derbyshire to be a training officer for the local Home Guard, and to be plunged headlong into a new wartime mystery. It is not long before he meets the &amp;lsquo;fighting soldier&amp;rsquo; of the title, a tough veteran of the Spanish Civil War and dozens of other bloody battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when chewing-gum is discovered wedged into the barrel of a bomb launcher, it is obvious there&amp;rsquo;s an individual&amp;mdash;or more than one&amp;mdash;in the camp out to make sure someone doesn&amp;rsquo;t live to fight another day. And it&amp;rsquo;s not long before their diabolical intent leads to explosive murder. Once again, it will be down to Travers&amp;rsquo;s quick wits to make sense of it and bring the guilty to justice&amp;mdash;with able support from George Wharton of Scotland Yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Case of the Fighting Soldier&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1942. This new edition features an introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
