  <title>The Venetian Venture - Suzette A. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1954, Venice. For Rosy Gilchrist the tables may have turned. Her boss at the British Museum, Dr Stanley, has chosen her to travel to Venice, track down a rare edition of Horace&#39;s Odes and bring it back for their collection. Rosy jumps at the chance to spend time away from her capricious supervisor and hopefully indulge in a little Venetian culture Following Dr Stanley&#39;s advice, she roams the cobbled streets of Venice in search of the book and crosses paths with old friends Felix Smythe and Cedric Dillworthy. With their help, Rosy thinks she&#39;s laid her hands on the treasure but things soon take a drastic downward spiral. A wealthy and eccentric recluse offers a ?1 million reward for anyone who can find Horace&#39;s Odes and pair it with a missing Murano vase. The price on the book&#39;s head brings all sorts of murky characters out of the shadows. Soon Rosy finds herself in a race against time as her rivals will go to any lengths to secure the prize . . . Even murder." />
