  <title>How to Lose a Client - Becky A. Bartness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kate Williams, Esq., has just started her own criminal defense law firm in Phoenix, Arizona, when Katherine Paar aka Tangerine, a new client, walks in and proposes a lucrative deal to bring Kate on as her attorney. Things get
complicated and events unfold quickly when the body of Tangerines ex-lawyer is discovered and Tangerine disappears. Kate, aided by MJ, her tattooed, pierced, and fashion-challenged paralegal and Sam, her sometimes
cross-dressing investigator, along with a cast of characters straight out of a John Waters movie, try to unravel the bizarre mystery and save Tangerines life. The action is fast and
fantastically funny, and Ms. Bartness proves once again that you can laugh at death." />
