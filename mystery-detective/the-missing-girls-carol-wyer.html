  <title>The Missing Girls - Carol Wyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;One girl found dead. Another girl gone...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long shadows danced on the tin walls. Inside the trunk lay Carrie Miller, wrapped in plastic, arms folded across her ribcage, lips sealed tight forever...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a girl&amp;#x2019;s body is found at a Midlands storage unit, it is too decomposed for &lt;b&gt;Detective Robyn Carter&lt;/b&gt; to read the signs left by the killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one knows the woman in blue who rented the unit; her hire van can&amp;#x2019;t be traced. But as the leads run dry another body is uncovered. This time the killer&amp;#x2019;s distinctive mark is plain to see, and matching scratches on the first victim&amp;#x2019;s skeleton make Robyn suspect she&amp;#x2019;s searching for a serial-killer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Robyn closes in on the killer&amp;#x2019;s shocking hunting ground, another girl goes missing, and this time it&amp;#x2019;s someone close to her own heart. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robyn can&amp;#x2019;t lose another loved one. Can she find the sickest individual she has ever faced, before it&amp;#x2019;s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An utterly gripping and darkly compelling detective thriller that will have fans of Robert Dugoni, Angela Marsons and James Patterson hooked from the very start. You will not guess the ending!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;The Missing Girls:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Absolutely blew me away!&lt;/b&gt; ... man was this &lt;b&gt;amazing!&lt;/b&gt; ... &lt;b&gt;Would I recommend this book? YES! A million times yes!&lt;/b&gt; I can&amp;#x2019;t say enough amazing things about &lt;i&gt;The Missing Girls&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Mini Mac Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Fantastic, right from page one I was totally hooked&lt;/b&gt;. I loved the characters, the story, and the writing style, everything about it. This book was full of twists and turns, it was emotional, dark in places and &lt;b&gt;impossible to put down&lt;/b&gt;. I genuinely didn&amp;#x2019;t guess the ending which was awesome! ... &lt;b&gt;one of the best books that I have read&lt;/b&gt; so far in 2017. Totally deserves 5 Stars.&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Bonnies Book Talk&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Wow, wow, wow!!&lt;/b&gt; What a fantastic book ... &lt;b&gt;I literally cannot wait until the next book&lt;/b&gt;. This series is getting stronger with every book, and if you haven&amp;#x2019;t read them yet, then this is a huge recommendation for you to do so. &lt;b&gt;Fantastic author, fantastic series, fantastic book! Five big fat stars!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Stardust Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Truly gripping and compelling ... holy cow, the ending!&lt;/b&gt; Talk about being utterly sucker-punched! &lt;b&gt;I was so blown away&lt;/b&gt;, I almost thought the world tilted off its axis! ... &lt;b&gt;I can hardly wait to get my grabby hands on book four!&lt;/b&gt; Did I mention that ending?!&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Novel Deelights&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Wow!&lt;/b&gt; Where to start? &lt;b&gt;I absolutely loved this book&lt;/b&gt; and was actually sad when I finished it ... I was so so sad to bid farewell to Robyn Carter. She is such a fabulous character. She is strong, intelligent, tough but compassionate ... This is &lt;b&gt;one of the best crime books I have read this year&lt;/b&gt; ... I am eagerly awaiting the next book! Like&lt;b&gt; really REALLY cannot wait for the next book!&lt;/b&gt; I highly recommend this book.&amp;#x2019; Goodreads Reviewer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;Holy Missing Girls Batman by Carol Wyer.
