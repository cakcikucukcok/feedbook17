  <title>Bleeding Darkness - Brenda Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Two murders, fourteen years apart, both shrouded in secrets.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 
David McKenna lies dying in a Kingston hospital, his children gathered from across the country to say a final goodbye. But the family reunion opens old wounds. David’s only daughter, Lauren, never recovered from the unsolved murder of her high school best friend Zoe Delgado fourteen years earlier — or the suspicion that her brother, Tristan, was behind it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Before David breathes his last, Tristan’s pregnant wife, Vivian, disappears and the Major Crimes Unit is called in to help find her. With Kala Stonechild stuggling to reconnect with her foster niece, and Woodhouse making trouble for Staff Sergeant Jacques Rouleau, tensions are running high on the team, but they must put their personal problems aside when Vivian’s strangled body is found frozen on the Rideau Trail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With a winter storm sweeping the shores of Lake Ontario, the team uncovers unspeakable betrayals that give more than one suspect a reason to kill … and raise fears that the two killings were only the beginning …" />
