  <title>The Prodigal Nun - Aimée Thurlo, David Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Thief in Retreat&lt;/i&gt; is a thoroughly absorbing, sharply drawn story with a protagonist who is courageous, intelligent, and endearing. Sister Agatha, with her restored Harley Davidson motorcycle and ex-police dog, Pax are a dynamite team that&#39;s hard to beat... I eagerly await Sister Agatha&#39;s next adventure.&quot; - Earlene Fowler, author of &lt;i&gt;Delectable Mountains&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Aimee and David Thurlo&#39;s nimble plotting leaves readers turning pages while Our Lady of Hope Monastery&#39;s compelling characters draw you into their richly textured world. Sister Agatha is a blessing and you&#39;ll believe in &lt;i&gt;Prey for a Miracle!&lt;/i&gt;&quot; --Julia Spencer-Fleming, Edgar finalist and author of &lt;i&gt;To Darkness and to Death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Lady of Hope is an aging monastery run by a cloistered order in rural New Mexico. Perennially cash-strapped for needed repairs and maintenance, when the local diocese offers to pay for a new water well it is, well, a godsend. But there&#39;s a catch - in return, they want the monastery to house a novice nun from a different order who needs a place to stay locally while she teaches at the Catholic school and an order to take responsibility for her while she&#39;s there. And Sister Josephine - Sister Jo as she likes to be called - is a handful. Loud, boisterous, free with her opinions, inappropriate, impulsive and snores loud enough to wake the dead, the young nun doesn&#39;t fit in well with the contemplative order and the older nuns of Our Lady of Hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the teeth-grinding of the older nuns and the repetitive deep sighs of the Reverand Mother weren&#39;t enough, there&#39;s also the increasingly dangerous sounding threats that arrive at the monestary. Since Sister Agatha has been involved in her fair share of investigations, there&#39;s no lack of people who might harbor a grudge against her. But is she really the target? And is Sister Jo - who arrived right before the threats began - somehow entangled in this increasingly dangerous web?&lt;/p&gt;" />
