  <title>Folly - Bill Noel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chris Landrum is about to have it all-an extended vacation, a second home at the beach, and early retirement in his fifties. There&#39;s only one glitch: murder is part of the package on the small South Carolina barrier island of Folly Beach, where eccentric residents live bohemian lifestyles in the shadow of historic Charleston.&lt;/p&gt;
Soon after settling in Folly Beach, Chris is befriended by an unlikely cadre of quirky locals: a real estate agent who looks like an out-of-season Santa with an attitude; a waitress who shares rumors and effuses charm; a professor; a lovely, intelligent, and unattached reporter; and a president-quoting, tag-along companion. He is fascinated by the company of his newfound friends, the novelty of the strange island that they call home, and the contrast of it all with stately Charleston. But when Chris finds the body of a prominent developer and lands in the middle of the Folly Beach spotlight, he immediately becomes a threat to the killer-and his vacation paradise might be the scene of his own untimely death.&lt;/p&gt;
Vacations aren&#39;t nearly as much fun when one of your new acquaintances is trying to kill you, and catching a murderer is not the normal way to spend an extended holiday. But on Folly Beach, what&#39;s normal?" />
