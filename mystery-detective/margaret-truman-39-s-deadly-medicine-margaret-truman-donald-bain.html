  <title>Margaret Truman&#39;s Deadly Medicine - Margaret Truman, Donald Bain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donald Bain continues the beloved Capital Crimes series with &lt;i&gt;Margaret Truman&#39;s Deadly Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, a gripping tale of greed, betrayal--and murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone in the pharmaceutical industry came upon a cheaper, non-addictive, and more effective painkiller, would he kill for it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington D.C. private detective Robert &quot;Don&#39;t call me Bobby&quot; Brixton, along with his mentors, attorneys Mac and Annabel Smith, discover that the answer is a resounding &quot;Yes,&quot; as they try to help Jayla King, a medical researcher at a small D.C. pharmaceutical firm, carry on the work of her father. His experiments in the jungles of Papua New Guinea in search of such a breakthrough product led to his brutal murder and the theft of his papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Jayla&#39;s father&#39;s lab assistant kill the doctor and steal his research? Is this shadowy figure prepared to kill again to keep Jayla from profiting from her father&#39;s work? Does her recent paramour&#39;s romantic interest reflect his true feelings--or will he sell her out and reap the rewards for himself? And to what lengths would Big Pharma&#39;s leading lobbyist go to cover up his involvement, and to protect a leading champion of the pharmaceutical industry--a Georgia senator with a shady past? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mac, Annabel, and Brixton soon realize, no pill can ease the pain that the answers to these questions inflict on everyone in this tale of greed, betrayal--and murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
