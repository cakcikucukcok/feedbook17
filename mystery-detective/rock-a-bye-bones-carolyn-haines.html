  <title>Rock-a-Bye Bones - Carolyn Haines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Carolyn Haines will once again delight readers with the next sparkling Sarah Booth Delaney mystery, &lt;i&gt;Rock-a-Bye Bones&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Booth Delaney knows the perfect way to begin recovering from both the recent attack on Scott Hampton&#39;s blues club and her broken heart. She&#39;s going to host a Thanksgiving feast for all of her friends at her ancestral home in Zinnia, Mississippi. But one bitterly cold night with the holiday just around the corner, Sarah Booth awakens to the insistent ring of her doorbell. She opens the door to find a newborn baby in a basket sitting on her front porch...and a pool of blood slowly seeping out from the basket. Before she can respond, an engine guns and a dark vehicle takes off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the police and a doctor ensure the baby is otherwise safe and healthy, Sarah Booth calls Tinkie Richmond, her partner at the Delaney Detective Agency. They know they need to do everything they can to find the baby&#39;s mother...even if they are starting to fall in love with the baby themselves. But as they track the baby&#39;s mother, Sarah Booth soon begins to suspect the woman might have been in danger; in fact, she might have been running for her life. And following in the woman&#39;s footsteps, Sarah Booth might find her own life on the line next.&lt;/p&gt;" />
