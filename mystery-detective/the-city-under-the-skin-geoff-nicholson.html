  <title>The City Under the Skin - Geoff Nicholson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A cartographic thriller with so many twists and turns it requires its own map&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cartography-obsessed misfit clerk from an antique map store in a district that&#39;s not quite trendy yet. A bold young woman chasing the answer to a question she can&#39;t quite formulate. A petty criminal hoping the parking lot he&#39;s just purchased is the ticket to a new life of respectability with his school-age daughter. A ruthless but vulnerable killer and his disgruntled accomplice. In &lt;i&gt;The City Under the Skin&lt;/i&gt;, it&#39;s not fate that will bind these characters together but something more concrete and sinister: the appearance of a group of mysterious women, their backs crudely and extensively tattooed with maps.&lt;br&gt;     They have been kidnapped, marked, and released, otherwise unharmed. When one turns up on the doorstep of the map shop and abruptly bares her back, only to be hustled away by a man in a beat-up blue Cadillac, it&#39;s the misfit clerk Zak, pushed by his curious new friend Marilyn, who finds himself reluctantly entering a criminal underworld whose existence he&#39;d prefer to ignore.&lt;br&gt;     In this haunting literary thriller, Geoff Nicholson paints a deft portrait of a city in transition. His sharply drawn characters are people desperate to know where they are but scared of being truly seen. A meditation on obsession and revenge, a hymn to the joys of urban exploration, &lt;i&gt;The City Under the Skin&lt;/i&gt; is a wholly original novel about the indelible scars we both live with and inflict on others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
