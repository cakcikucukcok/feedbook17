The roar of his gun was deafening in the small room as Malo placed two shots, chest high, into his body.  The man&#39;s body edged backward as he was rocked back on his heels, and then rebounded to the tips of his toes.  His body did a slow pirouette, falling face down on the floor.  He was dead before he completed the fall. 	This was one killing too many for the Chicago Police who ordered Malo to take a long vacation or they would take away his license.  	Malo&#39;s new client hired him to purchase a valuable coin in Cardiff, California where he encounters deception, intrigue, murder and a professional hit man." />
