  <title>Evan Blessed - Rhys Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Evan Blessed&lt;/i&gt;, award-winner Rhys Bowen has again delivered a charming and suspenseful cozy mystery set in Wales.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constable Evan Evans is almost done planning his wedding. Just as he is ready to relax, he meets a hiker whose girlfriend has gone missing on Mt. Snowdon. A search for the girl yields no trace but instead turns up a bunker complete with chains and handcuffs. Are the two related? And if so, where is the girl being held?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of clues make Evan and the police realize that they are dealing with a clever but twisted mind. Then a second person vanishes and this time Evans knows the victim: his fiancé. Her disappearance makes Evans realize that the culprit&#39;s vendetta might be quite personal-and directed at Evans himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
