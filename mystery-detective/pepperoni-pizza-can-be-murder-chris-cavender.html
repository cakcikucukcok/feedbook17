  <title>Pepperoni Pizza Can Be Murder - Chris Cavender</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For once, it seems, no one is trying to pin a murder on Eleanor Swift, owner of the scrumptious pizzeria A Slice of Delight in the quiet little town of Timber Ridge, North Carolina. But someone has to answer for that body in her kitchen.  .  .and it looks like the final stop for Greg Hatcher, her deliveryman, may be the state penitentiary.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleanor knows Gregg would never have lethally bashed his own brother in the head with a pizza-rolling pin. Sure, Wade was greedily claiming far more than his fair share of their family inheritance. And Gregg did catch his ex-girlfriend Katy smooching on the couch with Wade. It&#39;s no wonder that Timber Ridge&#39;s police chief--and Eleanor&#39;s ex-sweetheart--has his sights set on finding and arresting poor Gregg. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Eleanor and her saucy sister Maddy dig a little deeper into the mystery, they find Wade&#39;s enemies begin to outnumber the slices on a large pie. This is one mystery that&#39;s made to order, and if Eleanor and Maddy don&#39;t find out who killed Wade, Gregg&#39;s delivery days are over. But while finding the killer is one thing, escaping alive to dish the goods to the police is quite another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes delicious pizza recipe!&lt;/b&gt;" />
