  <title>Follow Her Home - Steph Cha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A stunning, edgy debut introducing Juniper Song, an amateur sleuth taking on the darkness in the veins of L.A. with razor-sharp wit and a breaking heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juniper Song knows secrets-how to keep them and how to search them out.  As a girl, noir fiction was her favorite escape, and Philip Marlowe has always been her literary idol. So when her friend Luke asks her to investigate a possible affair between his father and a young employee, Juniper (or &quot;Song&quot; as her friends call her) finds an opportunity to play detective. Driving through L.A.&#39;s side streets, following leads, tailing suspects-it all appeals to Song&#39;s romantic ideal of the noir hero. But when she&#39;s knocked out while investigating a mysterious car and finds a body in her own trunk, Song lurches back to the real L.A., becoming embroiled in a crime that goes far beyond role play. What&#39;s more, this isn&#39;t the first time Song has stuck her nose in other people&#39;s business. As she fights to discover the truth about her friend&#39;s family, Song reveals one of her own deeply hidden secrets, something dark and damaging, urging her to see the current mystery through, to rectify the mistakes of her past life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dazzling debut from fresh new talent Steph Cha, featuring a strong, modern, sharply observant heroine with an unforgettable voice, &lt;i&gt;Follow Her Home&lt;/i&gt; takes readers through dangerous twists and turns, beyond the glittering high-rises and freeways of L.A. on a case that will stay with them long after the final page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Follow Her Home&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[Song] is a compelling and original protagonist... One only hopes that Cha and her driven, neo-noir detective have more opportunities to explore those troubling intersections over many books to come.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;LA Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stephanie Cha&#39;s brilliant debut is as Noir as Old Nick&#39;s sense of humour. Compelling from first to last page, she takes on contemporary L.A., sweeping the reader through Chandler&#39;s twilight, heartbroken city from mansions to faux K-town hostess bars.  L.A. Noir at its finest.&quot; -- Denise Mina, author of &lt;i&gt;The Dead Hour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Follow Her Home&lt;/i&gt; takes a fresh trip down the sunny, dark streets of Los Angeles, and Juniper Song is a great guide - young, sharp, and worldly-wise. Keenly observed and deeply felt, the story slowly got under my skin. I couldn&#39;t put it down.&quot; - Meg Gardiner, Edgar Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;Ransom River&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In a glittery L.A. of pretty, privileged twentysomethings, Stephanie Cha&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Follow Her Home&lt;/i&gt; opens like a playful homage to Raymond Chandler but deepens into something darker:  an utterly 21st-century  ode to sisterhood in the face of crime.  A fast-paced thriller told in smart, sparkling prose, &lt;i&gt;Follow Her Home&lt;/i&gt; is a moving exploration of mothers and daughters, men and women, immigrant history, loss, and hope.&quot; -Joy Castro, author of &lt;i&gt;Hell or High Water&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
