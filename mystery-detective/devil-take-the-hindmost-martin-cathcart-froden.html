  <title>Devil Take The Hindmost - Martin Cathcart Froden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winner of the Dundee International Book Prize
At £10,000, the Dundee International Book Prize is the richest prize for an unpubished novel in the UK.
This year&#39;s winning title, Devil Take the Hindmost, is a gripping historical noir set during the amphetamine-fuelled craze for velodrome racing which took London by storm in the late 1920s.
Into this world stumbles Paul, a bewildered Scottish farmboy running away from home. Powerfully built with a fierce passion for cycling, he is taken under the wing of Silas, a local loan shark, and from there enters a world he is ill-equipped to survive.
As the races get harder, the bets get larger, and the terrifying Mr Morton starts to take an interest in Paul&#39;s career. For fans of Peaky Blinders and Brighton Rock, Devil Take the Hindmost is a thrilling ride through a historical London that is rarely visited.
&#39;A Graham Greene-esque noir with suspense and peril. I loved the cut back and forth of the time line to create drama...&quot; Denise Mina, author and judge, Dundee International Book Prize
&#39;Intriguing, thrilling and brilliantly realised. A fantastic debut.&#39; Danny Wallace, author, broadcaster and judge, Dundee International Book Prize
&#39;Perhaps the first cycling noir I&#39;ve ever read, Martin Cathcart&#39;s excellent debut, Devil Take the Hindmost, is filled with early twentieth century period detail and a slow-burn sense of menace that builds over the course of its twisting plot. But a good plot is nothing without character, and in the innocent abroad Paul and his new &#39;friend&#39; Silas, we have one of the finest double acts I&#39;ve read in a while. Devil Take the Hindmost is an assured first novel from an author who deserves to overtake the competition and race to take first place.&#39; Russel D McLean, author of the J McNee detective series" />
