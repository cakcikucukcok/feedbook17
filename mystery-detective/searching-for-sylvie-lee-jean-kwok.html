      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Instant&lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Read with Jenna&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;Show Book Club Pick!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Powerful . . .&amp;#160;A twisting tale of love, loss, and dark family secrets.&amp;#8221; &amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Paula Hawkins, #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The&amp;#160;Girl on&amp;#160;the Train&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Into the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poignant and suspenseful drama that untangles the complicated ties binding three women&amp;#8212;two sisters and their mother&amp;#8212;in one Chinese immigrant family and explores what happens when the eldest daughter disappears, and a series of family secrets emerge, from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Girl in Translation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It begins with a mystery. Sylvie, the beautiful, brilliant, successful older daughter of the Lee family, flies to the Netherlands for one final visit with her dying grandmother&amp;#8212;and then vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy, the sheltered baby of the Lee family, is too young to remember a time when her parents were newly immigrated and too poor to keep Sylvie. Seven years older, Sylvie was raised by a distant relative in a faraway, foreign place, and didn&amp;#8217;t rejoin her family in America until age nine. Timid and shy, Amy has always looked up to her sister, the fierce and fearless protector who showered her with unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happened to Sylvie? Amy and her parents are distraught and desperate for answers. Sylvie has always looked out for them. Now, it&amp;#8217;s Amy&amp;#8217;s turn to help. Terrified yet determined, Amy retraces her sister&amp;#8217;s movements, flying to the last place Sylvie was seen. But instead of simple answers, she discovers something much more valuable: the truth. Sylvie, the golden girl, kept painful secrets . . . secrets that will reveal more about Amy&amp;#8217;s complicated family&amp;#8212;and herself&amp;#8212;than she ever could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deeply moving story of family, secrets, identity, and longing,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Searching for Sylvie Lee&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive portrait of an immigrant family. It is&amp;#160;a profound exploration of the many ways culture and language can divide us and&amp;#160;the impossibility of ever truly knowing someone&amp;#8212;especially those we love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;This is a true beach read! You can&amp;#8217;t put it down!&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Jenna Bush Hager,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Today &lt;/em&gt;Show&amp;#160;Book Club Pick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
