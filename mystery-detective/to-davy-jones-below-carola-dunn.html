  <title>To Davy Jones Below - Carola Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In late 1923 the newly married Daisy Dalrymple and Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard take an ocean voyage to America for their honeymoon. Accompanied by Daisy&#39;s childhood friend Phillip Petrie, his wife, Gloria, and Gloria&#39;s father, American millionaire industrialist Caleb P. Arbuckle, Daisy and Alec are looking forward to a pleasant, uneventful trip. But at the last minute they are joined by Arbuckle&#39;s new friend, Yorkshire millionaire Jethro Gotobed, and his new wife, Wanda, a showgirl whom all but Gotobed are convinced is a gold digger of the worst sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, having barely lifted anchor, the ocean liner is beset by a series of suspicious accidents and deaths. With harsh weather and rough seas putting many-including Alec-out of commission due to seasickness, it soon falls to Daisy to figure out what connection there might be between the seemingly unrelated incidents. Convinced that there&#39;s a murderer aboard ship, Daisy must unmask the culprit or culprits before anyone else-especially herself-falls victim.&lt;/p&gt;" />
