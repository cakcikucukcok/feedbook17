  <title>Seven Stories - MORI Hiroshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;She disappeared before I knew it, but appeared near me at the next moment. Like a witch.&quot; (from &quot;Which Is the Witch?&quot;)  This is the first English collection of Dr. MORI, Hiroshi&#39;s seven short stories. It includes two works from &#39;S&amp;M (Saikawa &amp; Moe) Series&#39;, which has been overwhelmingly popular over two decades, and has been made into a TV drama series and a TV animation series.  Dr. MORI is Japan&#39;s best novelist, selected as a &quot;Hall of Fame Author&quot; by Amazon.co.jp. This is the birth of what can be considered the miraculous compilation, selected from a vast amount of his star-studded, diverse works. An interpretative script written by Ryusui Seiryoin (Chief Editor of The BBB / Translator) is also included.  Finally, the world discovers &quot;Dr. MORI, Hiroshi&quot;, the legendary mystery novelist from Japan.  This collection includes: &quot;The Girl Who Was the Little Bird&quot; &quot;A Pair of Hearts&quot; &quot;I&#39;m In Debt to Akiko&quot; &quot;Silent Prayer In Empty&quot; &quot;Kappa&quot; &quot;The Rooftop Ornaments of Stone Ratha&quot; &quot;Which Is the Witch?&quot;" />
