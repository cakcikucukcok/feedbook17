  <title>Killer Gourmet - G. A. McKevett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Plus-sized P.I. Savannah Reid and her pals at the Moonlight Magnolia Detective Agency know a thing or two about fine dining. But when murder shows up on the menu, it&#39;s time to go back to the kitchen.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Moonlight Magnolia gang learns their friends Ryan Stone and John Gibson are planning to open a chic new restaurant, they eagerly offer their input on everything from what dishes to serve to how many calories they should contain. But all Ryan and John can think about is how excited they are to have hired the temperamental but talented chef Baldwin Norwood. Too bad the only thing being sliced and diced in the kitchen is the chef himself.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Savannah turns her attention from munchies to murder, she quickly realizes the cantankerous chef left a bad taste in everyone&#39;s mouth, and any number of people could have whipped up a recipe for revenge. Could the jilted sous chef he stabbed in the back have done the same to him? Perhaps the loyal girlfriend he took for granted was finally fed up. Or maybe the business partner whose career he ruined had an appetite for blood. Savannah has her work cut out for her, and just when she thinks there couldn&#39;t be any more suspects, she uncovers a plot more precarious than a perfect souffl&amp;eacute;.  .  ." />
