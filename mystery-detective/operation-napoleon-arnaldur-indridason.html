In 1945, a German bomber crash-lands in Iceland durign a blizzard. Puzzlingly, there are both German and American officers on board.

He sets off, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, only to disappear into the white vastness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to the present. The U.S. Army is clandestinely trying to remove the wreck of an airplane from an Icelandic glacier. A young Icelander, Elias, inadvertently stumbles upon the excavation and then promptly disappears.

Kristin must solve the riddle of Operation Napoleon, even if it means losing her own life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arnaldur Indridason has proven himself to be a master of the mystery genre with his critically acclaimed Inspector Erlunder series, which has sold more than 6 million copies. Now, world-class writing and nonstop action meet in this spellbinding page-turner, which catapults Arnaldur Indridason to the top ranks of international thriller writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
