  <title>10 Mystery Short Stories - Rachel Swenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this combo of 10 different mystery and crime stories, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy the following short reads:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1 A somewhat humorous story about a spy who finds out that the truth is entirely different from what he expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
2 A gangster who scams, steals, and evades the cops but turns out to be someone completely opposite of piece of scum he appears to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3 Notes from a mobster who falls in love with the boss&amp;rsquo; daughter (not a good idea).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4 A cozy witch mystery about a young witch who discovers a beauty potion, something that may come in handy or may be too dangerous to give to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5 A classic investigation with a detective who interrogates murder suspects, with a twist ending.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
6 The writings on the wall predict the next victims. What has happened here? And will the main character be next?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
7 A werewolf is in town. The main character suspects her boyfriend. But is it really that simple? Read and find out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
8 An entire monument has disappeared. A magical force is at play. The future of the city is at stake.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
9 Ghosts in the city. A magical violin, and a strange power from the underworld.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10 A college girl who can command a whole army of monsters must be special. At first, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t think so, but eventually, she finds out what her true talent is.&lt;br /&gt;
