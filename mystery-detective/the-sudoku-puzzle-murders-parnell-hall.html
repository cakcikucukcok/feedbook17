  <title>The Sudoku Puzzle Murders - Parnell Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cora Felton, the Puzzle Lady (who actually couldn&#39;t solve a crossword puzzle to save her life), is surprisingly good at sudoku, so it&#39;s no problem when a Japanese publisher asks her to write a sudoku book. But when two Japanese publishers show up in Bakerhaven to vie for her services, Cora is a little confused. Which one did she actually sign with? Which one has the stunning geisha wife? And which one is about to be arrested for murder? The two men are archenemies and will go to great lengths to ace out each other. But would they stoop to murder? Someone is littering the town with sudoku, crossword puzzles, and dead private eyes. It&#39;s up to Cora, with the help of her niece, Sherry, to solve the puzzle, the sudoku, and the murder, before the killer strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parnell Hall delivers another entertaining, puzzle-packed adventure with his delightfully untraditional sleuth in &lt;i&gt;The Sudoku Puzzle Murders&lt;/i&gt;, featuring for the first time sudoku puzzles by &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; crossword editor Will Shortz.&lt;/p&gt;" />
