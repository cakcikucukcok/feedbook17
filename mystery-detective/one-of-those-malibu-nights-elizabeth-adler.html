  <title>One of Those Malibu Nights - Elizabeth Adler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author of &lt;i&gt;Meet Me in Venice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was just one of those Malibu nights, dark as a velvet shroud, creamy waves crashing onto the shore, breeze soft as a kitten&#39;s breath....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Private Investigator to the stars, Mac Reilly, hears the sound of a woman&#39;s scream over the crashing waves, his low-key beach-bum lifestyle is changed forever. A beautiful, distraught woman wearing only a black lace negligee stands in the doorway of a fabulous beach house. In her hand, a gun, and it&#39;s pointed directly at him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac escapes her bullet, but barely. Who is that woman? Days later she&#39;s disappeared and the Smith &amp; Wesson she almost killed him with finds its way into his car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so coincidentally, Allie Ray, star of the big screen and America&#39;s sweetheart, has also gone missing. The two women are connected, and Mac suddenly finds himself tangled up in a web of deception. He&#39;s going to need some help if he&#39;s going to get to the bottom of it all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where Sunny Alvarez comes in. Sunny and Mac have an on-again, off-again relationship. Lately it&#39;s been more off than on. But now he needs her more than ever.    Together they go on a quest that takes them from Southern California, to the beaches of Mexico, to the streets of Rome, and the countryside of France. All the while they&#39;re one step behind an elusive murderer and one step ahead of an actress who wants nothing more than to get lost....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Elizabeth Adler&#39;s trademark descriptions, plot twists, and irresistible characters, &lt;i&gt;One of Those Malibu Nights&lt;/i&gt; is beach-reading suspense at its best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
