Even more horrifying is that the trigger was apparently pulled by a twelve-year-old boy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That story begins on the other side of London in rough North Kensington, where the three, mixed-race, virtually orphaned Campbell children are bounced first from their grandmother to their aunt. The oldest, fifteen-year-old Ness, is headed for trouble as fast as her high-heeled boots will take her. That leaves the middle child, Joel, to care for the youngest, Toby. No one wants to put it into words, but something clearly isn&amp;#8217;t right with Toby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long, there are signs that Joel himself has problems. A local gang starts harassing him and threatening his brother. To protect his family, Joel ends up making a pact with the devil&amp;#8212;a move that leads straight to the front doorstep of Thomas Lynley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anatomy of a murder, the story of a family in crisis,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;What Came Before He Shot Her&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a powerful and emotional novel, full of deep psychological insights, that only the incomparable Elizabeth George could write.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
