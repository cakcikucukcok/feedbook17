  <title>Nothing Is Sacrosanct - David Balaam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dark, twisted yet with a very real pertinence to modern society, ‘Nothing is Sacrosanct’ takes readers deep into the life of an adult victim of child abuse whose own personality demons turn his streak for vengeance into a cinematic adventure. But, fiction aside, the narrative has a wholly-serious message – that anything can be changed, anyone can be brought to account, and no one is sacrosanct. Marcus Hartstein was abused as a young boy in Austria by his parents during the Second World War. In 1946 he is rescued by a kindly Doctor from the British Sector as suspicion is growing about his mother&#39;s death. When his friend and saviour is killed along with his wife, he vows revenge, and to protect his now-orphaned step-sister, Barbara. Marcus is constantly fighting his dormant memories of his early life, and his treatment by his parents, and vows revenge on behalf of other young boys who have been harmed." />
