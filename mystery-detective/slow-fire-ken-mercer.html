  <title>Slow Fire - Ken Mercer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One morning, Will Magowan opens his mail and finds a mysterious job offer to become the police chief of Haydenville, a tiny town in rural Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a highly decorated LAPD narcotics detective, Will was terminated after a devastating personal tragedy drove him to become addicted to the heroin he was charged with keeping off the streets. Fresh out of rehab but jobless and estranged from his wife, Will now lives alone in an old Airstream trailer on the fringes of L.A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of options, Will accepts the job. After moving to Haydenville, he discovers that the once postcard-perfect town is being corrupted by a criminal influence that threatens to destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haydenville&#39;s normally law-abiding citizens begin to erupt in acts of unspeakable violence. Pets are going missing at an alarming rate. Stately Victorian homes are falling into disrepair.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only a rookie officer at his disposal, Will risks everything in his quest to save Haydenville--entering a labyrinth of dark secrets that have remained buried for almost 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An emotionally complex and literate page-turner, &lt;i&gt;Slow Fire&lt;/i&gt; marks the electrifying debut of a new series featuring Will Magowan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
