  <title>Death in Dyker Heights - S.K. Saks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hal Silver is back and hes crankier than ever.  But who can blame him?  Hes been hired by a mob kingpin who wants him to find out who murdered his son Vinny Viano and he doesnt have a clue where to start.  And his only help is the dim witted gangsters assistant whose only concern is how many pieces he wants to break Hal into should he fail to solve the case.
Wandering the south Brooklyn streets of Dyker Heights, Hal meets neighborhood characters and cronies, babes and bumblers.  No one has a bad thing to say about Vinny, but someone clearly didnt like him as much he let on.  And if Hal doesnt find the killer soon, the next corpse may be his own." />
