  <title>Dark Road Home: A Gin Sullivan Mystery - Anna Carlisle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The summer after she graduated from high school, Gin Sullivan&#39;s little sister Lily went missing. Her family fell apart, not to mention her relationship with her high school sweetheart, Jake. Now, almost twenty years later, Gin is living in Chicago and working as a medical examiner when she gets the call: a body&#39;s been found in the woods outside her small hometown. It could be her sister. After all these years, it&#39;s time for Gin to go home and face the demons she tried to leave behind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Confronting your past is never easy, but for Gin it also means confronting Jake, who was the prime suspect in Lily&#39;s disappearance. To find an answer to the question of what happened to her sister that fateful summer, Gin makes the difficult decision to use her talents as a medical examiner to help the police investigation. But as Gin gets deeper into the case, she uncovers a shocking truth that could change everything--if it doesn&#39;t destroy what&#39;s left of her and her family first.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Buried secrets come to light in &lt;I&gt;Dark Road Home&lt;/I&gt;, Anna Carlisle&#39;s sharp and simmering debut mystery.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
