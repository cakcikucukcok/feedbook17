  <title>The Rampant Reaper - Marlys Millhiser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Literary agent and amateur sleuth Charlie Greene accompanies her mother to her great-great-aunt&#39;s funeral under great duress--after all, Charlie herself is adopted, and this part of her extended family has never made her feel that welcome. Plus, it&#39;s in Myrtle, Iowa, about as far from Charlie&#39;s life as a high-powered California literary agent as one can get. But she agrees to go. How bad could it be? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of Marlys Millhiser&#39;s quirky, offbeat mysteries, that is the world&#39;s biggest rhetorical question. Because someone may be offing the elderly in this midwestern town&#39;s only nursing home, and it falls to Charlie, the suspicious outsider, to put all the pieces together. Dealing with a passel of wacky relatives she&#39;s never met and a vicious killer as well won&#39;t be the easiest task she&#39;s ever been handed, but Charlie&#39;s good humor and recently acquired investigative experience should be more than enough to finish the job. That is, if she can escape the prying eyes that seem to peer at her from every corner of the tiny town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millhiser outdoes herself yet again in &lt;i&gt;The Rampant Reaper&lt;/i&gt;, an effort sure to leave both loyal fans and new readers clamoring for the next installment of this unconventional and engaging series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
