  <title>A Christmas Festival - Derek McFadden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Novelist (&lt;i&gt;On Ashlyn&#39;s Bridge&lt;/i&gt;) and poet (&lt;i&gt;Prose from a Grandson to a Senior Fellow&lt;/i&gt;), Derek McFadden returns with a spirited novella that sparkles with the magic and joy of holidays past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though afflicted with cerebral palsy, the main character, Walter Mathews, fueled by the timeless words of loving encouragement inherited from his dead father, has been blessed with a wife and daughter and holiday traditions that are eternal. It is this loving memory of his Papa and the festive holiday celebrations they once shared that allow him and his family to wake up one Christmas morning to fresh-baked pies, loving sarcasm, ageless wisdom and inspired blessings that have crossed the great divide.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A timeless story, as inspiring and entertaining in the middle of summer as it is during the holiday season, grab a cup of hot apple cider, a slice of warm apple pie, and cuddle up with this treasure for the soul. You&#39;ll soon smell the aroma of pine needles and hear the excited voices of generations of children as they await the arrival of that special day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
