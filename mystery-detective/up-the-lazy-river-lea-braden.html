      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Science teacher Samantha Grant thinks the final step in the pursuit of her new life in picturesque River Bend will be simple. Unfortunately, she could not be more wrong. As she walks into Al Roths Roth Restoration Inc., to view the remodeling plans for her newly inherited home, Samantha has no idea she is about to stumble into the middle of a murder mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Told that Al is out of the office by his wife, Claire, Samantha begins poring over the renovation plans. But when foreman Steve Kovacev bursts into the office to report a foul smell in a building, he asks the women to come with him to investigate. Moments later, the trio discovers the remains of Al Roth, community leader, provider of second chances to ex-convicts, and bankroller to his army buddies. When Claire hesitantly agrees to talk with the police, Samantha accompanies her for supportand immediately finds herself plunged into an investigation fueled by deception, revenge, and the kidnapping of her beloved Shih Tzu, Bo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting murder mystery set in a sleepy town next to a gentle river, Samantha must rely on her scientific prowess to discover the truth. Now only time will tell if she will find the answers in time to save Bo and prevent another murder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
