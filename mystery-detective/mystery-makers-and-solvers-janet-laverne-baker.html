From the Author 
Almost every young girl of my generation was a fan of the Nancy Drew books. I was no exception. As a twelve-year-old, I decided to create a club called Mystery Makers and Solvers. Once a week, my friends and I would get together, and we would give book reports of the most recent novels read about Nancy Drews mysteries. We would then exchange books or go to the public library for more in the series. This action spurred my interest in reading mysteries as an adult. A number of years ago, I decided to write a novel myself as I felt I had an adventure inside me. As it happens, I had three of them and a heroine that I named Christine Travis. She is my Nancy Drew. I hope that you will enjoy her life and adventures as much I did in creating them." />
