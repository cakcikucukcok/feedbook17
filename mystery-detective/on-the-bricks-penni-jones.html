  <title>On the Bricks - Penni Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cass Blankenship was just released after spending ten years in prison for a murder she didn&amp;rsquo;t commit. All she really wants to do now is head for sunny California, a place where nobody knows she was convicted of killing her ex-boyfriend&amp;rsquo;s ex-wife. But, the terms of her parole have her released to live in her sister&amp;rsquo;s halfway house back home in Arkansas where she&amp;rsquo;s bunking with speed freaks and hookers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cass can get her parole transferred if she stays out of trouble, but trouble is all she seems to find. She can&amp;rsquo;t even go to the grocery store without running into someone who thinks she should still be in prison. It feels like her only choice is to enlist help from her hesitant but desperate parole officer to find the real killer and clear her name for good. But first she has to find her sister, who&amp;#39;s probably taken off to do meth, then try to save Blankenship House from foreclosure, and help a teenaged felon deliver a baby, all while avoiding her ex and his Wrangler snake. And if her plan goes south, she&amp;rsquo;ll be back in the can by Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
