  <title>Never Look Back and Unauthorized Withdrawal - F. Eugene Barber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She had enough. He had come home drunk again last night.  He didn&#39;t hit her but he yelled and ranted and raved. He had been this way since he lost his job of over 20 years. Nobody could talk to him--she least of all. Six months of abuse was enough. 
&quot;I&#39;m leaving and I&#39;m never looking back. I&#39;m going as far west as I can go.&quot;
She looked in the rearview mirror and for a second it looked just like the road in front of her. 
She shook her head and kept driving. &quot;I&#39;m going to be alright.&quot;
If you notice the cover--the rearview mirror has the same highway scene as through the windshield.

UNAUTHORIZED WITHDRAWAL
He couldn&#39;t forget his grandfather&#39;s total loss during the Great Depression--the bank did it. 
He staked out the bank for two weeks. He made his move. He slipped in just as the guard opened the door at 10:00 am. No customers. Only one clerk had his window open--he grabbed the money and limped out--the heavy blue velcro tied cast showing. Once outside he ran. He got away clean to southern California in one of the eastern canyons where they raised cattle. 
He was in love. His new girlfriend had found out and said,  &quot;You have got to give it back.&quot;" />
