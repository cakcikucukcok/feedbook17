  <title>Head Games - Thomas B. Cavanagh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I have a tumor in my head. I call it Bob . . .&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With two ex-wives, a fifteen-year-old daughter who hates him, and a soon-to-be-fatal brain tumor nicknamed Bob, retired police detective Mike Garrity doesn&#39;t have a lot to live for. He&#39;s resigned himself to spending his last months alone, until an old colleague offers him a chance to go out with a bang, leave his daughter with an inheritance, and maybe even earn her respect. &lt;br&gt;Twenty-two year old TJ Sommerset is a member of the hit boy band Boyz Klub, a millionaire, and missing-in-action, putting at risk a world tour and millions in endorsements. He&#39;s also the idol of Mike&#39;s teenage daughter, Jennifer. So when Boyz Klub&#39;s frantic manager hires Mike to locate his golden goose, Mike&#39;s all too happy to make one last attempt to impress Jennifer. However, it isn&#39;t long before Mike discovers that there are other people looking for TJ as well. And once a headless corpse shows up, it&#39;s clear that they&#39;re not just after him for his autograph.&lt;br&gt;Fast-paced and acidly funny, &lt;i&gt;Head Games &lt;/i&gt;sends up the best (and the worst) of Orlando&#39;s entertainment industry, marking Thomas B. Cavanagh as a name to watch in the world of Florida crime fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
