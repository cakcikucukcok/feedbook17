  <title>Prey to All - Natasha Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Barrister Trish Maguire has too much on her plate: not only is she swamped with work, but her father has just suffered a heart attack and he&#39;s not likely to pull through. The last thing Trish needs now is a seemingly unsolvable case, one closer to her heart than she ever would have thought possible. But inconvenience has never stopped this tenacious, young lawyer from taking on a case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman Trish chooses to defend, Deb Gibbert, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering her father. With almost no one on her side, not even her public defender, Deb cannot hope to see the light of day ever again. That is, unless she can convince someone like Trish of her innocence. But Trish needs no convincing-upon hearing Deb recount the details of the night her father died, Trish comes to believe that circumstantial evidence convicted this innocent daughter and mother of four. Staying up nights in the intensive care unit to watch over her unconscious father gives Trish time to reflect upon the case against her client. As Trish delves deeper into the case, doubts begin to cloud her judgment: perhaps Deb is a ruthless killer who deserves her sentence. But Trish&#39;s nerves are stretched to breaking point when one of Deb&#39;s only supporters is shot dead at his own front door. With an unflagging faith in equal justice, Trish finds herself face to face with several truths, each tantalizing her further into a giant hall of mirrors. Prey to All is as rich in compassion as it is in anger, and the interwoven subplots turn what seems a simple case into a test of faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
