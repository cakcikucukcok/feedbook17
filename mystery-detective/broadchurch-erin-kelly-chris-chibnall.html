  <title>Broadchurch - Erin Kelly, Chris Chibnall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This remarkable adaptation of the hit television show &lt;i&gt;Broadchurch&lt;/i&gt;  from Erin Kelly (based on Chris Chibnall series) tells the story of a  shattered family, a reeling town, and the two imperfect detectives trying to bring them answers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the sleepy British seaside town of Broadchurch, Detective Ellie Miller has just returned from vacation, only to learn that she&#39;s been passed over for a promotion at work in favor of outsider Alec Hardy. He, escaping the spectacular failure of his last case, is having trouble finding his way into this tight-knit community wary of new faces. But professional rivalry aside, both detectives are about to receive some terrible news: 11-year-old Danny Latimer has been found murdered on the beach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Ellie it&#39;s a personal blow; Danny was her older son&#39;s best friend. She can&#39;t believe anyone in Broadchurch would ever have harmed him. But Alec considers everyone, even Danny&#39;s parents, suspect in his death. It&#39;s a living nightmare for everyone involved...even before the press arrive and start stirring up the secrets every town member keeps hidden behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
