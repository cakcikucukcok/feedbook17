  <title>The Dean&#39;s List - Gerald Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two campus murders in less than a week shake a small university to its core.  The deaths of the Dean of Business and Technology and a student leader have life-changing consequences for Roger Holt, a middle-aged professor who is pressured by top administration into assuming the duties and responsibilities of his late supervisor and to serve as the Interim Dean.  Reluctantly Holt complies because of his loyalty to Great Plains University.
Chet Evans, a detective on the police force, needs Holts knowledge of the campus and higher education in general to help solve the cases.  Unfortunately for Holt, Evans is not alone in realizing that Roger may be an integral part of the solutions.  Amid all this intrigue is the promising romantic relationship between Roger and an unexpected partner.  Events spiral out of control until Roger is about to become the third victim." />
