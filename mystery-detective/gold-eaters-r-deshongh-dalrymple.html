  <title>Gold Eaters - R. DeShongh Dalrymple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Haunted by his past, mining engineer Jerry Lane returns to the Antelope Valley to dig for gold where he encounters evil corporate thieves and the ghost of a teenaged schoolteacher murdered seventy years earlier. From the beginning, Lane is suspicious of the job offer from Pan American Gold, a respectable Canadian mining company operating in California&#39;s Mojave Desert. He&#39;s a drunk and a troublemaker-his past, no secret-and he wonders why the firm&#39;s beautiful CEO manipulated him into taking the position. It makes no sense to him, but instead of finding answers he&#39;s confronted with additional puzzles. A young woman appears before him in spirit form asking for his help so she can go home. While struggling to understand what that means, mine security officers vanish and the mine president and his family disappear, along with the company&#39;s accounting books. As chief engineer now responsible for the mine, Lane is pressed to solve these mysteries, and in the process finds the unexpected within himself." />
