  <title>The Cold Way Home - Julia Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;[An] emotion-charged mystery.... Keller&#39;s sleuths are easy to like and the murder story is moving; but the object of fascination here is Wellwood, a state-run mental institution with a dark history as a repository for &#39;rebellious, unruly women.&#39;&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning author Julia Keller welcomes readers back to West Virginia, where her lyrical and moving stories of the people of her native state have unfolded since &lt;i&gt;A Killing in the Hills&lt;/i&gt;, the acclaimed first novel in the series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep in the woods just outside Acker&#39;s Gap, West Virginia, rises a ragged chunk of what was once a high stone wall. This is all that remains of Wellwood, a psychiatric hospital for the poor that burned to the ground decades ago. And it is here that Bell Elkins - prosecutor turned private investigator - makes a grim discovery while searching for a missing teenager: A dead body, marred by a ghastly wound that can only mean murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve the mystery of what happened in these woods where she played as a child, Bell and her partners - former sheriff Nick Fogelsong and former deputy Jake Oakes - must confront the tangled history of Wellwood and its dark legacy, while each grapples with a private torment. Based on a true chapter in the troubled history of early treatment for psychiatric illness, &lt;i&gt;The Cold Way Home&lt;/i&gt; is a story of death and life, of despair and hope, of crime and  - sometimes, but not always - punishment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
