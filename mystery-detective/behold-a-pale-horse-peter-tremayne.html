  <title>Behold a Pale Horse - Peter Tremayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A perplexing case of murder and conspiracy in the pagan wilds of Northern Italy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 664 A.D., just after the events detailed in &lt;i&gt;Shroud for the Archbishop,&lt;/i&gt; Fidelma of Cashel takes a unexpected detour on her trip home from Rome. While in the port at Genua (modern day Genoa), Fidelma--sister of one Ireland&#39;s kings and an advocate in her country&#39;s law courts--receives word  that one of her old teachers, Brother Ruadan, is reaching the end of his days. Determined to see her old mentor one last time, Fidelma takes the treacherous journey to a remote abbey in the countryside--a place where the old pagan religion still has a hold and where even the Christians are often in bloody conflict with each other. But after she hears her dying teacher&#39;s last words, Fidelma&#39;s most dangerous adventure has just begun. With one murder after the next and a vicious war in the offing, it is up to Fidelma, alone and on her own, to unravel an extraordinary conspiracy before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
