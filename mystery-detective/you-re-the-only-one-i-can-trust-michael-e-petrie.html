  <title>You’Re the Only One I Can Trust - Michael E. Petrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The glint of a gun barrel caught his eye  it was the second to last thing wealthy Los Angeles businessman Griffin Gambil would ever see. There is a loud, percussive pop, a spume of red, and the final seconds of his life are spent watching his own blood spilling onto his Gucci loafers before collapsing in the driveway of his mistress house  the ink on his Last Will and Testament still wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in another part of L.A., attorney Benjamin Harding  feeling jilted by the legal system  is turning his back on the practice of law after twenty years. Ben now looks forward to spending his days as a carefree sun worshiper and people watcher along one of Southern Californias most fascinating stretches of sand, Venice Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just settling into his new life, Ben is contacted by the long lost love from his youth  newly widowed, Samantha Zimmer-Gambil  asking Ben to handle her deceased husbands estate. Finding the woman of his dreams once again available, Ben reluctantly agrees to take on this one last legal matter  but it quickly exceeds what he intended. Officially ruled as suicide, Samantha is certain her husband was murdered, enlisting Ben to go above and beyond the call of your average probate attorney in trying to discover who killed her late husband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for clues takes the reader on a fun but dangerous romp, surfing and sailing through the ocean communities of Los Angeles and offshore to the isles of Santa Catalina and Hawaii. &lt;i&gt;YOURE THE ONLY ONE I CAN TRUST &lt;/i&gt;offers up a fine webbing of plot twists, unusual suspects, aspects of travelogue, legal primer, and a touch of the bizarrely erotic, spun together in a murder mystery that will keep the reader guessing right to the final page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
