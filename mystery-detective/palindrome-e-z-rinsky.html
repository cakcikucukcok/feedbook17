  <title>Palindrome - E. Z. Rinsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalist for the ITW Thriller Award for&amp;#160;Best First Novel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private Eye Frank Lamb&#39;s business is simple: He finds things. Be it the world&amp;#8217;s hottest pepper seed in a South American dictator&#39;s safe or a pair of Italian art forgers sipping Prosecco in a Miami hotel room, he delivers the goods and collects his check, never with a smile. Work is work, and he doesn&amp;#8217;t let it get in the way of the life he&amp;#8217;s made for himself and his ten-year-old daughter, Sadie.&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;But when a staggeringly beautiful woman offers him a small fortune to find a cassette tape, curiosity gets the better of him. It contains, she explains, a recording her sister&amp;#8217;s kidnapper made of her last three minutes on Earth. She conveniently fails to mention the unsettling effects the tape is rumored to have on listeners.&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;Frank takes the case, and enlists the help of reclusive tracker Courtney Lavagnino to pick up a trail that&#39;s been cold for five years. As their search leads them through a horrifying labyrinth of murder and madness, it becomes clear they&#39;re chasing much more than a memento.&lt;/p&gt;" />
