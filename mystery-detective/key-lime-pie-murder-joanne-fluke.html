  <title>Key Lime Pie Murder - Joanne Fluke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;New York Times Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It promises to be a busy week for Hannah Swensen. Not only is she whipping up treats for the chamber of commerce booth at the Tri-County fair, she&#39;s also judging the baking contest; acting as a magician&#39;s assistant for her business partner&#39;s husband; trying to coax Moishe, her previously rapacious feline, to end his hunger strike, and performing her own private carnival act by juggling the demands of her mother and sisters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With so much on her plate, it&#39;s no wonder Hannah finds herself on the midway only moments before the fair closes for the night. After hearing a suspicious thump, she goes snooping&amp;#8211;only to discover Willa Sunquist, a student teacher and fellow bake contest judge, dead alongside an upended key lime pie. But who would want to kill Willa and why? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Hannah needs to crank up the heat, hoping that Willa&#39;s killer will get rattled and make a mistake. If that happens she intends to be there, even if it means getting on a carnival ride that could very well be her last.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yummy. . .Fluke has developed a charming supporting cast who all feel like friends by the time the murder is solved. The dozens of tempting recipes Fluke includes are an added treat.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
