  <title>A Dose of Murder - Lori Avocato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After years of chasing around sniffly munchkins with a tongue depressor, nurse Pauline Sokol has had it. She&amp;#39;s sick of being an &amp;#34;angel of mercy&amp;#34;&amp;#8212;she&amp;#39;d like to raise some hell for once! But finding a new career won&amp;#39;t be easy for someone who&amp;#39;s had no experience beyond thermometers and bedpans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the smarmy head of an agency that investigates medical fraud thinks she&amp;#39;d be perfect for the job, since, for him, a potential employee&amp;#39;s most important qualification is a killer pair of legs. So now Pauline&amp;#39;s a p.i., but since she knows as much about detective work as a potted geranium might, the hunky and mysterious Jagger steps in to teach her the ropes. Her first assignment&amp;#8212;going undercover at a local clinic to investigate fake insurance claims&amp;#8212;promises to be a hoot ... until the healers around her start inexplicably dropping dead. And before she can say, &amp;#34;streptococci,&amp;#34; Pauline&amp;#39;s stuck in a true health care crisis with her own continued wellness in very serious jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
