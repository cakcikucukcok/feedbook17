  <title>The Homeplace - Kevin Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Culled from the rarefied air of James Lee Burke, Greg Iles, and John Hart, Kevin Wolf has fashioned a painstakingly perfect tale of murder, angst, and the enduring power of the human spirit. If the late, great Pat Conroy had ever decided to write a mystery, this would be it.&quot; --Jon Land&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kevin Wolf&#39;s debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Homeplace,&lt;/i&gt; succeeds in every way. He has crafted a gripping, fast-paced narrative with beautifully drawn characters in an authentic and interesting small-town Colorado setting. Not only is the mystery compelling, but so are the characters. Even if there were no murders to solve, you would still want to spend time with these fascinating people whose lives echo the sparse and gorgeous landscape they inhabit and whose pasts refuse to leave them to their futures.&quot; --Christine Carbo, author of &lt;i&gt;The Wild Inside&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Ford was the first of four generations of Ford men to leave Comanche County, Colorado. For Chase, leaving saved the best and hid the worst. But now, he has come home. His friends are right there waiting for him. And so are his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the murder of a boy, a high school basketball star just like Chase, rocks the small town. When another death is discovered--one that also shares unsettling connections to him--law enforcement&#39;s attention turns towards Chase, causing him to wonder just what he came home to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A suspenseful, dramatic crime novel, &lt;i&gt;The Homeplace &lt;/i&gt;captures the stark beauty of life on the Colorado plains.&lt;/p&gt;" />
