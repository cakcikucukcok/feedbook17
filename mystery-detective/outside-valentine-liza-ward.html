  <title>Outside Valentine - Liza Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A debut novelist interweaves a trio of voices--haunting, dangerous, full of longing--mysteriously linked by a shocking crime and the search to heal the past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many long years have passed since the winter of blinding white when Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate drove across the hushed midwestern landscape and left a trail of blood and pain. So why does Lowell, a Manhattan collector of antiquities, still dream of what happened, despite his wife&#39;s best attempts to draw him back and offer comfort? And who is Susan, the teenager who appoints herself a detective, piecing together the story of the murders while wondering if she&#39;ll ever be loved like Starkweather loved his girl?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&#39;s Caril Ann herself, who takes us back to relive the ride she swears she could not control. It began on the day Charlie first saw her, dangling her bare legs off the edge of a tree house. It ended outside Valentine, Nebraska, on that night when she still believed that life could somehow go back to being normal . . . &#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every so often a novel comes along that is capable of redeeming the losses it so devastatingly conveys. Disturbing, bittersweet, and lyrical, Liza Ward&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Outside Valentine&lt;/i&gt; is a story of people torn apart by tragedy and yet, finally, transformed by love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
