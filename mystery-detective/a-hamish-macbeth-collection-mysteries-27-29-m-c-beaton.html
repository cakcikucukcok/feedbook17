  <title>A Hamish Macbeth Collection: Mysteries #27-29 - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;This thrilling collection includes three of M.C. Beaton&#39;s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries, featuring Scotland&#39;s cleverest but most unambitious policeman?Ä¶&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Death of a Kingfisher&lt;br&gt;  When Scotland is hit by the recession, Police Constable Hamish Macbeth notices that the Highland people are forced to come up with inventive ways to lure tourists to their sleepy towns. The quaint village of Braikie doesn&#39;t have much to offer, other than a place of rare beauty called Buchan&#39;s Wood, which was bequeathed to the town. The savvy local tourist director renames the woods &quot;The Fairy Glen,&quot; and has brochures printed with a beautiful photograph of a kingfisher rising from a pond on the cover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  It isn&#39;t long before coach tours begin to arrive. But just as the town&#39;s luck starts to turn, a kingfisher is found hanging from a branch in the woods with a noose around its neck. As a wave of vandalism threatens to ruin Braikie forever, the town turns to Hamish Macbeth. And when violence strikes again,the lawman&#39;s investigation quickly turns from animal cruelty to murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Death of Yesterday &lt;br&gt;  When a local woman tells Sergeant Hamish Macbeth that she doesn&#39;t remember what happened the previous evening, he doesn&#39;t begin to worry. She had been out drinking, after all, and he&#39;d prefer not to be bothered with such an arrogant and annoying woman. But when her body is discovered, Hamish is forced to investigate a crime that the only known witness--now dead--had forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Death of a Policeman &lt;br&gt;  Local police stations all over the Scottish Highlands are being threatened with closure. This presents the perfect opportunity for Detective Chief Inspector Blair, who would love nothing more than to get rid of Sergeant Hamish Macbeth. Blair suggests that Cyril Sessions, a keen young police officer, visit the town of Lochdubh to monitor exactly what Macbeth does every day. Macbeth hears about Blair&#39;s plan and is prepared to insure that Cyril returns back to headquarters with a full report. But Cyril is soon found dead and Hamish quickly becomes the prime suspect in his murder." />
