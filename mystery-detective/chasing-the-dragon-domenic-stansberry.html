  <title>Chasing the Dragon - Domenic Stansberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A complicated, shadowy man in disgrace, Dante Mancuso leads a double life.  Lately, though, the line he walks has become razor thin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dante works for The Company, a nebulous security organization operating just this side of the law. Dante wants out, but it&#39;s a hard life to leave behind-rich with its own seductions, its own dark attractions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His latest assignment sends him back to his old North Beach neighborhood in San Francisco. First rendezvous? His estranged father&#39;s funeral in the dying heart of Little Italy. Here Dante picks up the strands of his old life and soon finds himself playing an even more elaborate game, a game that involves not just his duplicitous family, but also his ex-fiancée and his former colleagues in the San Francisco Police Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adept as he is, Dante can not play this game forever, pursued by the laconic Frank Ying, a Chinese detective anxious to know the secrets Dante hides. Caught between the sinister imperatives of The Company and the ghosts of his own past, Dante treads a harrowing path to a confrontation more lethal-and more surprising-than he could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Chasing the Dragon&lt;/i&gt;, Domenic Stansberry-the acclaimed writer of modern noir-introduces a new hardboiled series set in San Francisco. In this, the series opener, Stansberry tells a story written in clear homage to the masters of the genre, yet with an original, breathtaking voice all his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domenic Stansberry&#39;s recent novels include the Edgar Award and Hammett Prize finalist &lt;i&gt;The Last Days of Il Duce&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Manifesto for the Dead&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Confession&lt;/i&gt;.  He lives with his family in the San Francisco Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;" />
