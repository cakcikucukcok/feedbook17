  <title>Dust to Dust - Keith McNair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detective David Chandler grew up as a tough-minded streetwise kid who in later years found that life although cruel and cold was also a blessing in disguise if properly travelled. Rarely setting his heart adrift, Chandler lived on an island surrounded by an impenetrable field generated by his minds eye. However, Chandlers life and the things that gave it a sense of purpose would cause him to question his sense of right and wrong.
Denton Thorn was a young man who realized early on in life that he was born for a unique purpose. Neither pride nor the false riches the world had to offer would cause him to lose focus. Denton took his task to heart believing that the injustices of the world must be addressed and wherever possible rectified. This was his calling, this was his fate.
Finding the balance between good and evil will never go unchallenged, as one will always seek to dominate the other. For it is written that the embodiment of evil versus the physical nature of good will remain forever at war.
Two men thrust in the path of the others belief. Yet, only one can remain standing to claim the spoils of victory." />
