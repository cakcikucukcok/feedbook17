  <title>A Question of Belief: A Commissario Guido Brunetti Mystery - Donna Leon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Donna Leon&amp;#8217;s best-selling series featuring the principled, warmhearted Venetian Commissario Guido Brunetti has won her countless fans, critical acclaim, and international renown as one of the world&amp;#8217;s best crime writers. In &lt;i&gt;A Question of Belief&lt;/i&gt;, Brunetti must contend with ingenious corruption, bureaucratic intransigence, and the stifling heat of a Venetian summer. With his hometown beset by hordes of tourists and baking under a glaring sun, Brunetti&amp;#8217;s greatest wish is to go to the mountains with his family, where he can sleep under a down comforter and catch up on his reading. But before he can go on vacation, a folder with court records has landed on his desk, brought by an old friend. It appears that cases at the local court&amp;#151;hardly known as a model of efficiency&amp;#151;are being delayed to the benefit of one of the parties. A creative new trick for corrupting the system, perhaps, but what can Brunetti do about it? And just when it looks like Brunetti will be able to get away, a shocking, violent crime forces him to stay in Venice. This is a stellar addition to Leon&amp;#8217;s celebrated series: atmospheric, packed with excellent characters, and building to an explosive, indelible ending.&lt;/div&gt;" />
