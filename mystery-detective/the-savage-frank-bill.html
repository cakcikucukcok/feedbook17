  <title>The Savage - Frank Bill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the raucous and action-packed follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Donnybrook&lt;/i&gt;, mayhem is still the order of the day-only more so&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Frank Bill&#39;s America has always been stark and violent. In his new novel, he takes things one step further: the dollar has failed; the grid is wiped out.&lt;br&gt;     Van Dorn is eighteen and running solo, dodging the bloodthirsty hordes and militias that have emerged since the country went haywire. His dead father&#39;s voice rings in his head as Van Dorn sets his sights not just on survival but also on an old-fashioned sense of justice.&lt;br&gt;     Meanwhile, a leader has risen among the gangs-and around him swirls the cast of brawlers from &lt;i&gt;Donnybrook&lt;/i&gt;, with their own brutal sense of right and wrong, of loyalty and justice through strength.&lt;br&gt;     So, this is not the distant postapocalyptic future-this is tomorrow, in a world Bill has already introduced us to. Now he raises the stakes and turns his shotgun prose on our addiction to technology, the values and skills we&#39;ve lost in the process, and what happens when the last systems of morality and society collapse.&lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Savage&lt;/i&gt; presents a bone-chilling vision of America where power is the only currency and nothing guarantees survival. And it presents Bill at his most ambitious, most eloquent, most powerful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
