  <title>Counselor - Dave Aquino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Blam! &quot;That one&#39;s for me,&quot; Ted said, as he shoots and kills Peggy Reddick for what seems to be no justification. Jack Reddick, (Peggy&#39;s husband) a cop, on the hardest case of his life, feels the murder was pay-back for arrests he made. Willing do whatever it takes to find the man he wants, Jack will torment himself, while abandoning his children, who need him more than ever. &lt;br&gt;No leads, no motive and no trace of this man named Ted, Jack finds himself going crazy to know why. If given the opportunity to put everything on the line, just for a chance to find Ted, will Jack do it? Will he be fortunate enough to know what really happened? Or will Ted, without knowing it, end up killing Jack as well?  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dave Aquino is the author of several novels, including &lt;i&gt;Personal War, Personal War 2, Counselor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Slot Machine&lt;/i&gt;.
