  <title>Rowena Roman - Tarynne Bourret</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;People say you&#39;ll know it when you&#39;ve become an adult, but I don&#39;t think you really do. What do you call an adult? Is it when you can live on your own? When you do your own taxes? When you get married and have children? Or when you kill someone for the first time? Even now, I don&#39;t know.&quot;
Noah Harland didn&#39;t know what he wanted to do with his life. Even after entering a prestigious school through a scholarship, with the passing of two years, he still didn&#39;t have a clue. Mixed in with so many people within this school, he soon finds himself sitting behind a girl that is both known and yet invisible to everyone, someone who rarely speaks and yet holds an uncanny air around her.
But when dealing with this girl, Noah is soon pulled into a struggle that he never thought possible when he sees the girl die by the hands of a terrifying man with white hair. Noah flees for his life and into the safety of his dorm room only to emerge later and discover that the girl who died is somehow still alive, with no signs of any injuries.
Confused and fearful of what might happen to his life, Noah is soon dragged off form the school to where this girl lives and begins to discover things than he ever imagined." />
