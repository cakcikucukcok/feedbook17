  <title>For the term of his natural life - Marcus Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Marcus Andrew Hislop Clarke&lt;/b&gt; (24 April 1846 &amp;ndash; 2 August 1881) was an English-born Australian novelist and poet, best known for his novel &lt;i&gt;For the Term of His Natural Life&lt;/i&gt;. It is the best known novelisation of life as a convict in early Australian history. At times relying on seemingly implausible coincidences, the story follows the fortunes of Rufus Dawes, a young man transported for a murder that he did not commit. The book clearly conveys the harsh and inhumane treatment meted out to the convicts, some of whom were transported for relatively minor crimes, and graphically describes the conditions the convicts experienced. The novel was based on research by the author as well as a visit to the penal settlement of Port Arthur, Tasmania." />
