  <title>Murder Is Against the Law, but … - Patricia Graves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When she starts her job at Sawyer Developmental Center, Janet Nelson is young, attractive, and nave. It doesnt take long for things to change. Her innocence makes her a target, and she soon receives the attention of Barton Cleese, director at Sawyer. He wants to make Janet his mistress, and he will have herbecause he always gets what he wants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this corporate world, everyone is out for blood. Theres the assistant director, Cleeses current mistress, who is now in charge of training Janet as her replacement. There are supervisors and CEOs who will say yes to anything in exchange for a fat paycheck or a step up the ladder. Caught in a web of deceit and hostility, Janet must be on her guard on and off the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things take a turn for the worse, its Janet versus the Sawyer administration. She decides to take matters into her own hands, wreaking revenge on all those who have wronged her with the help of her intellect and her imagination. She knows murder is against the law, but some people need to die. Some people need to be destroyed for the good of humanity. &lt;/p&gt;" />
