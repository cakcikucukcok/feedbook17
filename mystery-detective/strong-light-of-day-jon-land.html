  <title>Strong Light of Day - Jon Land</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Texas ranger Caitlin Strong is involved in an international plot rooted in secrets from the Cold War in &lt;i&gt;Strong Light of Day, &lt;/i&gt;the seventh installment of Jon Land&#39;s &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling Caitlin Strong series&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Afghanistan, 2003&lt;/i&gt;: During a mountain raid, a team of Navy SEALs discovers plans for a new and ingenious attack on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Present&lt;/i&gt;: Fifth-generation Texas Ranger Caitlin Strong is summoned when thirty high school kids from a Houston prep school vanish during a field trip, including the son of her lover, Cort Wesley Masters. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Caitlin also has to deal with a crazed rancher whose entire herd of cattle has been picked clean to the bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between these two inexplicable events dates back to the contents of that Afghan cave raided by the SEALs, and a plot by forces within Russia to win a war they never stopped fighting. At the center of that plot are billionaire Calum Dane and his multinational conglomerate, currently embroiled in controversy over a genetically engineered pesticide that has the potential to eradicate hunger across the world. Dane doesn&#39;t know that this pesticide has spawned a new and deadly enemy capable of destroying the very fabric of American life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin&#39;s race to save the country weaves through the present and the past, confronting her with the most powerful and dangerous foes she&#39;s ever faced. The Cold War hasn&#39;t just heated up; it&#39;s boiling over under the spill of a strong light only Caitlin can shut off before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
