  <title>Everyone Lies - A. D. Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Everyone Lies&lt;/i&gt; by AD Garrett, DCI Kate Simms is on the fast track to nowhere. Five years ago she helped a colleague when she shouldn&#39;t have. She&#39;s been clawing her way back from a demotion ever since. Professor Nick Fennimore is a failed genetics student, successful gambler, betting agent, crime scene officer, chemistry graduate, toxicology specialist and one-time scientific advisor to the National Crime Faculty. He is the best there is, but ever since his wife and daughter disappeared he&#39;s been hiding away in Scotland, working as a forensics lecturer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Manchester, drug addicts are turning up dead and Simms&#39; superior is only too pleased to hand the problem to her. Then a celebrity dies and the media gets interested. Another overdose victim shows up, but this time the woman has been systematically beaten and all identifying features removed. The evidence doesn&#39;t add up; Simms&#39; superiors seem to be obstructing her investigation; and the one person she can&#39;t afford to associate with is the one man who can help: Fennimore.&lt;/p&gt;" />
