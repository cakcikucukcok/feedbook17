  <title>Park &amp; Die - Harris Wolfson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brach LaFave went from boy to man in the same last beat of his fathers heart. The mans body went to prison, and his mind went to the hell of why me and screw you. Perhaps it has become a cliche to say that there was a lot happening in 1960s San Francisco. The changes from that era are now a part of history, but there were also the unsolved murders. Park &amp; Die is based upon true events, embellished around the main character Brach Lafave. His battle pursues unanswered questions literally left in smoldering ashes to present day. Despite the twists and turns and sleight of hand, Brachs never-ending troubles are really just the anxiety of the story, the frame around the tortured portrait of an old man in pain.
Brach LaFave is huge character set into a mystery, and historical fiction with a pinch of romance, to understand him, you have to go back to the beginning and not loose sight of that scared, frail weakling, a boy 14, being bullied by some punk in a vacant lot. His father coming to his rescue is shot, right in front of his eyes; an excruciating transformation of boy to man. Along with the oozing blood, Brach seeped into the misery of hell. Decades, fate and love bring him incredible success, but he is still a haunted man. On a dreary Christmas Eve the answer he has been searching for literally comes to him while parked at a vista point overlooking the Pacific." />
