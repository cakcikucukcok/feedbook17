  <title>Righteous - Joe Ide</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this hotly anticipated follow-up to the smash hit &lt;i&gt;IQ&lt;/i&gt;, a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Critics&#39; Best of the Year and winner of the Anthony, Macavity, and Shamus Awards, Isaiah uncovers a secret behind the death of his brother, Marcus.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For ten years, something has gnawed at Isaiah Quintabe&#39;s gut and kept him up nights, boiling with anger and thoughts of revenge. Ten years ago, when Isaiah was just a boy, his brother was killed by an unknown assailant. The search for the killer sent Isaiah plunging into despair and nearly destroyed his life. Even with a flourishing career, a new dog, and near-iconic status as a PI in his hometown, East Long Beach, he has to begin the hunt again-or lose his mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A case takes him and his volatile, dubious sidekick, Dodson, to Vegas, where Chinese gangsters and a terrifying seven-foot loan shark are stalking a DJ and her screwball boyfriend. If Isaiah doesn&#39;t find the two first, they&#39;ll be murdered. Awaiting the outcome is the love of IQ&#39;s life: fail, and he&#39;ll lose her. Isaiah&#39;s quest is fraught with treachery, menace, and startling twists, and it will lead him to the mastermind behind his brother&#39;s death, Isaiah&#39;s own sinister Moriarty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With even more action, suspense, and mind-bending mysteries than Isaiah&#39;s first adventures, &lt;i&gt;Righteous&lt;/i&gt; is a rollicking, ingenious thrill ride." />
