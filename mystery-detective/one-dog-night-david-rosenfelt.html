  <title>One Dog Night - David Rosenfelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For only $6.99: Lawyer Andy Carpenter will have to pull out all of his tricks to get to the bottom of this cold case turned white hot in &lt;i&gt;One Dog Night&lt;/i&gt;, the latest in David Rosenfelt&#39;s popular mystery series. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For six years Noah Galloway has lived with a horrible secret and the fear that his rebuilt life could be shattered at any moment. Now his dread has become a certainty, and he has been arrested for the arson murder of twenty-six people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he needs is defense lawyer Andy Carpenter, who most definitely is not in the market for a new client. So Noah plays his hole card: a shared love for Andy&#39;s golden retriever, Tara, and the knowledge that Andy wasn&#39;t her first owner--Noah rescued Tara first. When Noah wasn&#39;t able to care for her any longer, he did everything in his power to make sure that she was placed in the right home: Andy&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andy soon learns that the long-ago event that may destroy Noah&#39;s life is only the beginning of an ongoing conspiracy that grows more deadly by the day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;*BONUS CONTENT: This edition of &lt;i&gt;One Dog Night&lt;/i&gt; includes a new introduction from the author and a discussion guide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
