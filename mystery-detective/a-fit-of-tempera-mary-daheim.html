      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Van Gogh-ing...going...gone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor Judith McMonigle Flynn! All she wants is a much-needed break from the rigors of running Hillside Manor. But she and cousin Renie have barely set foot in their family&#39;s backwoods vacation cottage...and already they&#39;re having a brush with the local law. It appears someone has painted their neighbor, world-renowned artist Riley Tobias, permanently out of the picture. And the artful slayer has managed to frame luckless Judith for the crime! But the model amateur sleuth isn&#39;t about to sit still for this , as she and her cuz canvas the countryside in search of a killer. Judith is certain the culprit can be found in the rogues&#39; gallery of oily agents, malicious mistresses, and crafty critics who inhabited the defunct da Vinci&#39;s surrealistic world. But the cousins could be painting themselves into a dangerous corner with this unofficial investigation...and setting themselves up for another fatal art attack.Poor Judith McMonigle Flynn!
