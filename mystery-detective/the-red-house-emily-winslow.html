With plans to move back there, the young couple travel to the city together, where Imogen&amp;#8217;s excitement is offset by Max&amp;#8217;s deeply unsettling d&amp;#233;j&amp;#224; vu: despite having no history there, something about Cambridge is all too familiar. As the wedding planning begins and Imogen&amp;#8217;s preoccupation with her lost younger brother intensifies, Maxwell is forced to consider that he may actually be Imogen&amp;#8217;s missing brother. Worse, he fears that she may already know that he is, and be marrying him anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Detective Chief Inspector Morris Keene languishes at home, struggling with a debilitating injury and post-traumatic stress, and his former partner, Detective Inspector Chloe Frohmann, investigates a suicide case in which Morris&amp;#8217; daughter is suspected of having a hand. When buried skeletons are discovered next to an old barn, the suicide is linked back to Imogen&amp;#8217;s childhood, revealing horrors of the past and triggering new dangers in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third book by talented author Emily Winslow and featuring Cambridgeshire detectives Morris Keene and Chloe Frohmann, &lt;em&gt;The Red House &lt;/em&gt;is a suspenseful and skillfully written mystery, twisting and unraveling in deft and unusual ways as the simultaneous investigations raise the question: for how long can you call your findings pure coincidence? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
