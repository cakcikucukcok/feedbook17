  <title>All the Wrong Places - Lisa Lieberman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grieving over a broken romance, her newborn son put up for adoption against her wishes, seventeen-year-old Cara Walden arrives in 1950s London with her half-brother Gray, a blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter and closeted homosexual. Fifteen years her senior, Gray has always looked after Cara. Their father, renowned director Robbie Walden, took little interest in his offspring; when he was not making movies, he was busy having affairs with young starlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cara&amp;rsquo;s mother, glamorous actress Vivien Grant, was one of Robbie&amp;rsquo;s conquests.&amp;nbsp;Her career ended tragically in 1943 when she was found drowned in the pool at the Walden estate. The death was ruled an accident, but rumors abounded. Vivien belonged to a clandestine Communist cell and was spotted in the company of a mysterious man not long before she died. And what was she doing, wandering the grounds of the estate in the early morning hours in her negligee?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Cara embarks on a film shoot in Sicily and begins a new love affair with a temperamental actor, she cannot help pondering the mystery surrounding her mother&amp;rsquo;s death. Did Robbie murder her out of jealousy, or did Vivien know too much? The questions she asks soon put Cara&amp;rsquo;s own life in danger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of old movies will get a kick from &lt;em&gt;All the Wrong Places, &lt;/em&gt;a historical mystery set in exotic European locales that pays tribute to the films of the forties and fifties, capped off with a thrilling finale straight out of Hitchcock.&lt;/p&gt;" />
