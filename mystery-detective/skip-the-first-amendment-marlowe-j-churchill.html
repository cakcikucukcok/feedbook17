  <title>Skip the First Amendment - Marlowe J. Churchill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reporter Skip Easley, known more for his office sexual escapades than his writing prowess, is not exactly thrilled when he receives his next assignmentthe murder of a topless dancer in Tacoma, Washington. To Easley, the life of a topless dancer on the sordid dance circuit is a feature story thats already been written a dozen times over.
When another dancers information suggests that theres gang involvement in the entertainment industry, Easley doesnt take it seriously. For this and various other reasons, hes relieved of his position at the newspaper. But the story follows him to Riverside, California, where he has been lucky enough to have landed another journalist position. A beautiful topless dancer, Janelle Jones, goes to the US Attorney and divulges important information about the hotshot murdersmeant to look like a heroin overdoseand of a drug-running operation that employs topless dancers as couriers.
Janelle asks for Easleys help, and this time he doesnt think twice. It could be the opportunity he needs to write the big story that will keep him employed. But Janelle and Easley have underestimated their opponents, who have a far-reaching and powerful arsenal of resources." />
