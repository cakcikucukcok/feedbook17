  <title>Fieldwork - Mischa Berlinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A daring, spellbinding tale of anthropologists, missionaries, demon possession, sexual taboos, murder, and an obsessed young reporter named Mischa Berlinski&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his girlfriend takes a job as a schoolteacher in northern Thailand, Mischa Berlinski goes along for the ride, working as little as possible for one of Thailand&#39;s English-language newspapers. One evening a fellow expatriate tips him off to a story. A charismatic American anthropologist, Martiya van der Leun, has been found dead--a suicide--in the Thai prison where she was serving a fifty-year sentence for murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivated first by simple curiosity, then by deeper and more mysterious feelings, Mischa searches relentlessly to discover the details of Martiya&#39;s crime. His search leads him to the origins of modern anthropology--and into the family history of Martiya&#39;s victim, a brilliant young missionary whose grandparents left Oklahoma to preach the Word in the 1920s and never went back. Finally, Mischa&#39;s obssession takes him into the world of the Thai hill tribes, whose way of life becomes a battleground for two competing, and utterly American, ways of looking at the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivid, passionate, funny, deeply researched, and page-turningly plotted, &lt;i&gt;Fieldwork &lt;/i&gt;is a novel about fascination and taboo--scientific, religious, and sexual. It announces an assured and captivating new voice in American fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fieldwork&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
