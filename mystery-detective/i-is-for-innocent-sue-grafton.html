  <title>&quot;I&quot; is for Innocent - Sue Grafton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Readers of Sue Grafton&#39;s fiction know she never writes the same book twice, and &lt;i&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is For Innocent&lt;/i&gt; is no exception. Her most intricately plotted novel to date, it is layered in enough complexity to baffle even the cleverest among us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lonnie Kingman is in a bind. He&#39;s smack in the middle of assembling a civil suit, and the private investigator who was doing his pretrial legwork has just dropped dead of a heart attack. In a matter of weeks the court&#39;s statute of limitations will put paid to his case. Five years ago David Barney walked when a jury acquitted him of the murder of his rich wife, Isabelle. Now Kingman, acting as attorney for the dead woman&#39;s ex-husband and their child (and sure that the jury made a serious mistake), is trying to divest David Barney of the profits of that murder. But time is running out, and David Barney still swears he&#39;s innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterned along the lines of a legal case, &lt;i&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is For Innocent&lt;/i&gt; is seamlessly divided into thirds: one-third of the novel is devoted to the prosecution, one-third to the defense, and a final third to cross-examination and rebuttal. The result is a trial novel without a trial and a crime novel that resists solution right to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kinsey Millhone agrees to take over Morley Shine&#39;s investigation, she thinks it is a simple matter of tying up the loose ends. Morley might have been careless about his health, but he was an old pro at the business. So it comes as a real shock when she finds his files in disarray, his key informant less than credible, and his witnesses denying ever having spoken with him. It comes as a bigger shock when she finds that every claim David Barney has made checks out. But if Barney didn&#39;t murder his wife, who did? It would seem the list of candidates is a long one. In life, Isabelle Barney had stepped on a lot of toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is For Innocent&lt;/i&gt;, Sue Grafton once again demonstrates her mastery of those telling details that reveal our most intimate and conflicted relationships. As Kinsey comments on the give-and-take by which we humans deal with each other, for better and sometimes for worse, the reader is struck yet again by how acute a social observer Ms. Grafton can be. Frequently funny and sometimes caustic, she is also surprisingly compassionate-- understanding how little in life is purely black and white. Except for murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere out there, a killer waits to see just what Kinsey will find out. Somewhere out there, someone&#39;s been getting away with murder, and this time it just might turn out to be Kinsey&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is For Innocent&lt;/i&gt; is Sue Grafton in peak form. Fast-paced. Funny. And very, very devious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&lt;br&gt;&quot;B&quot; Is for Burglar&lt;br&gt;&quot;C&quot; Is for Corpse&lt;br&gt;&quot;D&quot; Is for Deadbeat&lt;br&gt;&quot;E&quot; Is for Evidence&lt;br&gt;&quot;F&quot; Is for Fugitive&lt;br&gt;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&lt;br&gt;&quot;H&quot; Is for Homicide&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is for Innocent&lt;br&gt;&quot;J&quot; Is for Judgment&lt;br&gt;&quot;K&quot; Is for Killer&lt;br&gt;&quot;L&quot; is for Lawless&lt;br&gt;&quot;M&quot; Is for Malice&lt;br&gt;&quot;N&quot; Is for Noose&lt;br&gt;&quot;O&quot; Is for Outlaw&lt;br&gt;&quot;P&quot; Is for Peril &lt;br&gt;&quot;Q&quot; Is for Quarry&lt;br&gt;&quot;R&quot; Is for Ricochet &lt;br&gt;&quot;S&quot; Is for Silence &lt;br&gt;&quot;T&quot; Is for Trespass&lt;br&gt;&quot;U&quot; Is for Undertow &lt;br&gt;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vengeance &lt;br&gt;&quot;W&quot; Is for Wasted &lt;br&gt;&quot;X&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
