  <title>The Best Martin Hewitt Detective Stories - Arthur Morrison, E. F. Bleiler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the&amp;nbsp;1890s, the heyday of Sherlock Holmes, Martin Hewitt ranked among England&#39;s most popular fictional detectives. A favorite of readers of&amp;nbsp;&lt;I&gt;The Strand&lt;/I&gt; and other magazines, Hewitt returns in this collection of nine of his best cases. &lt;BR&gt;Hewitt enters the scene in &quot;The Lenton Croft Robberies,&quot; in which he is called upon to solve three successive jewel robberies whose only clues are three half-burnt wooden matches. In &quot;The Case of the Dixon Torpedo,&quot; he must figure out how mechanical drawings for a new weapon could have vanished from an office that no one entered or left. In other cases, Hewitt examines the theft of a valuable cameo from a locked desk in a guarded house, the plunder of gold bullion from the hold of a sinking ship, and the disappearance of a will right from under the noses of the dying man&#39;s family. The final four stories concern a suicide that may be a murder, a marital case that isn&#39;t as simple as it seems, a clue to a treasure in a piece of music, and the robbery of a sacred relic. Novel and imaginative in subject matter, meticulously plotted, and smoothly written, these stories will captivate mystery lovers." />
