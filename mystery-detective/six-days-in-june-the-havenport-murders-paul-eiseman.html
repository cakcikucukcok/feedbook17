  <title>Six Days in June: the Havenport Murders - Paul Eiseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A SUNRISE CRUISE LEADS TO MURDER in this second Harrison Hunt mystery. Fans will delight in revisiting the noted theatre director, playwright and Shakespearean scholar as he and his long-suffering assistant Sophie encounter murder and mayhem in the  seemingly peaceful New England fishing village of Havenport. 
CRITICS AND READERS RAVED when they first met Harrison Hunt:
FIVE DAYS IN MAY: THE BROOKFIELD MURDERS is a breath of fresh air when it comes to mystery novels. Eiseman knows theatre inside and out so the story has that authentic backstage feelIt will remind you of those wonderful old films they dont make anymore. If Eiseman didnt just invent Harrison Hunt, the charmingly egocentric stage director, youd swear hed been sleuthing around for years.
A GRIPPING AND EXCITING WHODUNIT from first page to last. Author Paul Eiseman weaves an intricate tapestry of suspects, red herrings, clues, and mystery that will keep you guessing until the last possible moment.
IF YOURE UP ON SHOW BIZ TRIVIA, you might find yourself catching the killer.Then again, even with the clues right before your eyes, youll probably be as surprised as I was when everything came clear in the tense, final pages.  
 I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! The plot is always turning, The added bonus of getting a behind-the-scenes view of the theatre world is a delight! 
A DELIGHT TO READ The characters are fun and well defined and there is a lighthearted component to the work." />
