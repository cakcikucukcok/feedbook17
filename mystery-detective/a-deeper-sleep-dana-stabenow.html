  <title>A Deeper Sleep - Dana Stabenow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Deeper Sleep,&lt;/i&gt; her first novel since &lt;i&gt;Blindfold Game,&lt;/i&gt; the stand-alone political thriller that made Dana Stabenow a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller, Stabenow returns to the popular and award-winning Kate Shugak series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate, a private investigator, has been working on a case for the Anchorage District Attorney involving the murder of a young woman by her husband, a man named Louis Deem. Deem has been the subject of investigations before, and he&#39;s never been convicted of a crime. But Kate and her on-again, off-again lover, state trooper Jim Chopin, who arrested Deem, are convinced that this time it&#39;s different, and he&#39;ll finally be punished for his actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the jury returns a verdict of not guilty, Kate and Jim are devastated, and like the rest of the citizens of Niniltna, Alaska, certain that a man has gotten away with murder. They can&#39;t help but think that it&#39;s only a matter of time before he&#39;s in the frame for another killing. Sure enough, a few weeks later a shooting leaves two dead in an apparent robbery. But this time Kate and Jim have a witness, and they&#39;re not going to let Louis Deem get away again. Or will he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Stabenow, Edgar Award-winning author and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling thriller writer, delivers a gripping page-turner about one town&#39;s search for justice--at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
