  <title>Revenge of the Golf Gods - Howard Jahre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ben Hogan, considered to be the greatest striker of the golf ball, would beat balls on the practice range until his hands bled. He once said that in a good round, he hit just three shots exactly the way he wanted. He understood that golf is more a game of misses than a game of perfection.
Until a brash young amateur attempts to prove him wrong.
When Gordon Howard, trust fund baby and amateur golfer par excellence, comes to the sudden realization that his cushy job working for his fathers mega hedge fund has been a colossal mistake, his world free- falls into a tailspin.
Searching for fulfillment and meaning to his life, he throws caution to the wind and embarks on a mission to become a professional golfer on the PGA tour. His goal is to win the coveted US Open.
Amidst the pressure of his level headed girlfriend to abandon his pipedream, Gordon is contacted by a man he has never met, who offers him what he has been desperately searching for, an infallible golf swing. 
But the price Gordon pays for such perfection is much more than he ever bargained for." />
