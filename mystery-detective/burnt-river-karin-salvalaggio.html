  <title>Burnt River - Karin Salvalaggio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Detective Macy Greeley is called to Wilmington Creek, a sleepy ranching community in northern Montana, she expects an open-and-shut, if high-profile, murder case. What greets her is anything but. John Dalton, a soldier returned home from serving in Afghanistan, has been shot dead in an alleyway outside a local bar. Macy can&#39;t see any obvious motive for the attack, but John&#39;s closest friends and his twin sister, Jessie, have been keeping secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a series of wildfires pushing the area&#39;s resources to the limit and Darby Lake&#39;s water level dropping to a record low, Jessie is becoming increasingly anxious about what may be uncovered if the rains don&#39;t return to the valley soon. Haunted by what&#39;s hidden beneath the still waters, she doesn&#39;t know whether to help or hinder Macy&#39;s investigation. And Macy herself is increasingly uneasy about what she discovers as she navigates the politics of a small town and the Dalton family clan, as well as her own complicated relationship with the father of her young son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macy Greeley returns in &lt;i&gt;Burnt River&lt;/i&gt;, another taut and intimate mystery from acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Bone Dust White&lt;/i&gt; author Karin Salvalaggio.&lt;/p&gt;" />
