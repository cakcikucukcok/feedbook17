  <title>Stop Raping Sally - Jim Ivy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detective Jamie Bell has a problem; after she was forced to kill a madman during a shootout in a crowded bar she starts seeing things that arent there, namely a message, written everywhere she lookseven in her dreams. The message says, Stop Raping Sally. But who is Sally? And why cant anyone else see the message? 
The more Jamie learns about the man she killed, the more she thinks he might have something to do with the elusive Sally. According to his girlfriend, the madman kidnapped and sold a young girl just days before the shooting. Could this young girl be Sally? Another important question: is Jamie losing her mind? What other explanation could there be for the signs she sees, awake and asleep?
Maybe being a detective is too much for novice Jamie Bell. Maybe shes not cut out for this line of work. Or maybe shes just the person to find Sally and save her life. Could the shooter be the one responsible for Sallys abuse? If so, how will Jamie find the young girl, now that her abductor is dead? Jamie may be a girls only hope  if only she can face her own fears and take the law into her own hands." />
