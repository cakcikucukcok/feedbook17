  <title>So You Want to Get Married? - Nick Sanchez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If a wonderful and lasting marriage is what you want  this guides for you! So You Want to Get Married? is a must read for anyone currently in a serious relationship or thinking about entering into one. Initially written for his children, the author writes in a fatherly and personal way about how to avoid major issues that often lead to painful divorces. He also examines serious topics that better help you understand your potential spouse and identify your level of commitment to him/her. Through an insightful and simple process using the fingers of the hand, the author helps you think through and evaluate five critical areas everyone must consider before making a lifetime commitment to an individual. His innovative approach makes it easy for anyone to learn and remember the issues you truly need to address. With your acquired knowledge you will be better prepared to make a decision as to whether he/she is the right one for you  and whether you will have a wonderful and lasting marriage. This easy to remember set of principles brings clarity to the foggy world of love and marriage. The advice in this book is the most useful I have ever heard. I tell all my single friends about it. I definitely used it when I was dating, and now that Im happily married, I see things in my husband and I can say, I knew this was the man I was marrying! For me it is a great comfort. Tirsa S. Stewart So You Want to Get Married? is a concise and memorable checklist of five of the most important aspects to consider in a mate before making the big decision of marriage. It helped me sift through many different candidates as I searched for the man of my dreams. Now that I am living my fairy tale with him, I continue to share the five finger analysis with all my single friends in hopes that they will also be able to find a wonderful, loving companion to spend life and eternity with. Arisa S. Field The Five Fingers theory is what taught me what is essential to a good marriage. It does not teach that everyone needs to be perfect---to the contrary, it teaches that all people have flaws and that is normal. The question is whether you are willing to accept and live happily with the flaws of the one you are considering spending the rest of your life with. These are five things that no man/woman should look past when considering marriage. Azalea S. Klein It was hard growing up without ever having a boyfriend until I was 23. But the five finger rule is what kept me from settling! I now see that I avoided a lot of heart ache and bad choices by never getting serious with someone who didnt meet my basic five finger criteria. I am also grateful that while my husband is not perfect, I did get all five fingers... even the pinkie!. Stacey S. Carruth&lt;/p&gt;" />
