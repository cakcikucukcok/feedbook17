  <title>HIV &amp; Aids - Robert Duffy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are now more people living with HIV in the UK than ever&lt;br /&gt;
before. In 2015, an estimated 101,200 people in the UK were&lt;br /&gt;
living with HIV, 13% of whom were unaware of their infection.&lt;br /&gt;
More than 6,000 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in 2015.&lt;br /&gt;
This book can help people recognise signs and symptoms of&lt;br /&gt;
HIV and AIDS. It can also help people identify and avoid risky&lt;br /&gt;
behaviors that may lead to an HIV infection. Seeking to remove&lt;br /&gt;
the unknown from this mysterious disease, this book clears up&lt;br /&gt;
what HIV is, and how it is identified and treated. It also explains&lt;br /&gt;
other sicknesses you can get when you are HIV positive. Most&lt;br /&gt;
importantly, it talks about how to stay well and live a productive&lt;br /&gt;
life after finding out that you are HIV positive. It is a helpful&lt;br /&gt;
resource not only for people who have been diagnosed with&lt;br /&gt;
HIV or AIDS but also for their friends and family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wide target audience:&lt;br /&gt;
HIV or AIDs patients, health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who know someone who is HIV positive or has AIDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Clear concise step by step guide.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Includes detailed help list.&lt;/p&gt;" />
