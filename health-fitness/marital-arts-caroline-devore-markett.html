  <title>Marital Arts - Caroline DeVore Markett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was a weirdo in high school and college. I wanted to hang out with boys instead of girls and never could understand it. Hardly any girls wanted to hang out with me either, so I was a loner.&lt;p&gt;
Then when I became an adult, I had a personality profile done and discovered that a male member of our church had the same personality as I did. I was amazed! Then my light bulb turned on when I learned that only 15% of the people with my profile were females. My friend suggested that I write a book oriented toward that 15% so they could relate more easily to their husbands. So here it is!&lt;p&gt;
This book differs from others based on psychology in that it has a Christian basis and helps Christian women to understand themselves better. Also, I have heard that most women with this profile do not become Christians; hopefully this book will inspire them to do so.&lt;p&gt;
So how can I possibly know enough to write a book like this? I took psychology courses in college and have a Masters degree in Bible." />
