  <title>Living with a Silent Illness - Serenity Tipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are hundreds of thousands of individuals living with Non-Epileptic Seizures (NES) and Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Events (PNEE) all around the world.  This powerful, packed book explains in detail what all of the medical terms are, along with important information for individuals living with NES  PNEE.  The information in this book is for both the individual living with this illness as well, as their caregivers.
This book does not contain chapters, but sections, such as Seizures Disorder, Mental Distress, Abuse, Personal Stories, along with Testimonials of other individuals I had talked to.  This is not a one size fits all type of book.  There are so many different names and diagnosis for these issues, which many doctors, neurologist, and psychiatrists find it hard to describe what exactly the diagnosis should be.  With anticipation by reading this book, it will help individuals and their families to better understand what Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures, and Non-Epileptic Events." />
