  <title>Uncaged: The Rise of the Badass - Michelle Catanach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The road to womanhood is never an easy path, especially in a world driven by ego, fear, and misogyny.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, women have been treated less than, not just by men, but by women too. They have been&amp;nbsp;violated, abused, shamed, blamed and silenced. Denied their basic human rights. They&amp;rsquo;ve carried wounds and stories from the past, burdened by labels, told that they&amp;#39;re too much yet never quite enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They learned to please, to give away their power. To hide their gifts, and tame the wild woman inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result they&amp;rsquo;ve disconnected from who they really are, waging war within themselves and each other, using food, alcohol, sex, relationships and shopping as a way to self-medicate and stuff down the disease of not-good-enough-ness, while pushing and striving to create success in their work and life to prove themselves and their worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is craving&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More truth.&lt;br /&gt;
More vulnerability.&lt;br /&gt;
More authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;
More love.&lt;br /&gt;
More pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
More connection.&lt;br /&gt;
More intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More women willing to show up as their perfectly imperfect messy selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More women willing to uncage themselves from the stories of the past and live with passion, purpose, integrity and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More women reclaiming their power and owning their darkness as well as the light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Uncaged: The Rise of the Badass&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;26 trail-blazing women share their stories of strength from struggle, turning their mess into their message to empower and inspire their peers and future generations. These are women united in their mission to create positive change in the world through truth, authenticity&amp;nbsp;and an indestructible knowing that women are worthy and deserving of so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is part-memoir, part self-help, taking the reader on her own journey of insight, exploration and self-discovery so that she too can awaken to her truth and uncage the wild woman inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is an essential read for women of all ages, and a celebration of our strength, courage and resilience in the face of adversity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
