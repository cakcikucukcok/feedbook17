  <title>Let&#39;s Start with the Children - Al Colella, Steven Lippincott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Make the journey from the slave trade of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the plight of African Americans in inner-city America in the South Bronx. Learn about the ravages and disadvantages of residence there and its lifelong impact upon an entire population. Recognize that this continuing situation has a sad and shameful historical path shaped by societys blindness to humanity. This malaise of blindness exacted an unfair, immoral, and immeasurable human cost upon generations; a blindness which denied entry to the opportunities afforded others as a birthright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregated cost in the South Bronx is staggering beyond belief. There is, however, a collateral cost to the reservoir of national resources caused by a failure to recognizeand, therefore, unrealized and unavailablethe creativity, talents, skills, and potential of inner-city residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear those voices that have addressed the inequities of this situation; learn of individuals who believe in the humanity of every individual. Despite these voices, the deplorable inner-city situation continues and even worsens. Is anybody listening? There are listeners who have taken up the cause, albeit in the face of a lack of political, humanitarian, and spiritual wills. Learn about those listeners in a New England church community that made the trek to the South Bronx for a decade. One may perceive these two communities as radically different; experience the merger of two communities into a single family via the grace of a spiritual ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you can make a differencesomewhere, sometime, somehowand discover the difference in your being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from book sales will be directed to an educational fund specifically for the children of St. Anns community in the South Bronx.&lt;/p&gt;" />
