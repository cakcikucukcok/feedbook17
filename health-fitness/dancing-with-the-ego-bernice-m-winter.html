  <title>Dancing with the Ego - Bernice M. Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine yourself standing perfectly still. Suddenly, without any provocation your inner ego steps out and takes on a life of its own. It tells you to ignore the dance, to not laugh, to disregard the direction your heart leans toward. You are compelled to stay only in the past.  You are told, do not discover the newness that seeks to discover you. 
Dancing With the Ego sets the stage to recognize two parts that make up your present. You and your ego stand face to face. Your ego stands as a calculating search engine for the data of life experiences you have compiled over years. Your ego is there to remind you of the years of life experiences. The ego will inform you of your capabilities and your inabilities.
You are standing side by side with your ego. Do you choose to dance, or will you choose to sit this one out? 
When dancing you will need to determine who this partner is. You will sift through the words, feelings, and thoughts that jump out at you. You will be challenged to accept who your ego has become. You will be challenged to begin a series of new steps reprogramming your past. You will be challenged to displace the past with a present that informs a new direction.
