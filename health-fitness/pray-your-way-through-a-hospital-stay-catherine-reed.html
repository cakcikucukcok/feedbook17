  <title>Pray Your Way Through a Hospital Stay - Catherine Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 2010, Catherine Reed learned she had a brain tumor. In preparing for the challenging road ahead, Catherine relied on her faith and expected the best, despite the known risks. But what she did not expect was for God to choose that moment to bless her with a life-changing revelation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she lay on a gurney awaiting surgery, Catherine closed her eyes to visualize the comforting message of the psalm her husband was reading aloud. Moments later, she felt pressure on her shoulder. Catherine opened her eyes expecting to see her husband, but instead, saw a large hand turned so she could clearly see the nail hole in His palm. Catherine was filled with joy. Jesus was with her. After the surgery as she lay in the intensive care unit for days, Catherine details how God pulled her closer and revealed how prayer would become an integral part of her healing journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pray Your Way through a Hospital Stay shares one womans powerful testimony of how she prayed for herself and others throughout her illness and recovery, ultimately encouraging other hospital patients to find the same peace, healing, and love through their own quiet conversations with God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
