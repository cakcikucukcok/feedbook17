  <title>Real and Present Danger - Dr. Vijay Pabbathi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1. How to save our lives from the medical disasters?
2. How science is failing us and what to do about it?
3. What do doctors not want to hear?
4. What will happen in the UK and the USA during the next 10 years?
This book reveals an astonishing truth about conventional medical science
and it is packed with a unique angle of thinking about government-approved
medicines that are protected by pharmaceutical companies  which could shake
the philosophical foundation of medical science.
This book reveals that authorised medicines are causing more damage than the
destruction caused by the Indian Ocean Tsunami or recent Haiti earthquake.
Discover the scientific basis of estimated future deaths  break the code of death
due to drug reactions and uncover the secrets to resolve these future dangers.
When science fails us, the pharmaceutical companies make profit.
 From this book
The total death toll of medical science errors will exceed the
total death toll of the World War II, if we do not address this
problem immediately.
