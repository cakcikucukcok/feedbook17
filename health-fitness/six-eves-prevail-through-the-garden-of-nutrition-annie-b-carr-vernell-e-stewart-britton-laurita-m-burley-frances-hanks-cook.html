  <title>Six Eves Prevail Through the Garden of Nutrition - Annie B. Carr, Vernell E. Stewart Britton, Laurita M. Burley, Frances Hanks Cook...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the unique work Six Eves Prevail through the Garden of Nutrition, six African-American nutrition professionals share their individual stories about becoming nutritionists and dietitians during the 60s and 70s. These professions have typically seen low numbers of African-Americans. The women whose stories make up this book formed close personal and professional associations that have lasted over decades. The book documents the mentoring, professional guidance, and wisdom they each received from trailblazers in their respective professions. 
The importance of nutrition to the overall health of the population has been well documented. Though their career paths were different, each of these professional women made tremendous contributions to the health, wellbeing, and safety of their many patients, clients, students, and family members. Because of their backgrounds, they were able to bring a level of sensitivity to health care that was unsurpassed. 
Narrated through first-person accounts, the book is filled with humorous and heart-warming anecdotes, personal and local history, recipes, and photographs. Journey with these special women along their remarkable paths that demonstrate the power of perseverance, the importance of family and community, and lifting others as we are lifted." />
