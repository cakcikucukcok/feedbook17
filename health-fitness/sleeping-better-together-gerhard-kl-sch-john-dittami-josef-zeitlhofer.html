  <title>Sleeping Better Together - Gerhard Klösch, John Dittami, Josef Zeitlhofer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Sleeping with a partner is often difficult: many people suffer from sleep disorders, and others have sleep preferences that can disturb their bedmate. This book is for every couple that has found it difficult to share a bed, argued about his snoring or her restless legs, or woken up to the alarm feeling tired and cranky. The authors first explain how sharing a bed affects sleep quality, well-being, and the happiness of the relationship. They then discuss factors that cause couples&#39; sleep disturbances, from individual preferences to gender differences. They describe the connection between personality traits and sleep habits, and they reveal the ways in which age and aging affect our sleep. Most of all, they offer practical advice on how to sleep better with a partner, including getting-ready-for-bed rituals, the emotional and sexual aspects of sharing a bed, and guidelines for allowing children or pets into bed. The book also includes questions for assessing sleep needs and practical suggestions for ending arguments.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
