      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sneezes Often Come in Twos: The Journal of a Divorced Bachelor,&amp;quot; is the continuation of a story through the eyes of a father, who is adjusting to divorced life, all while rediscovering himself.

Sleek is determined to improve his quality of life and relationships. Most of the time he has been misunderstood and has misunderstood others, but the key to understanding is to keep asking questions, and questions he has plenty.

He grew up in the middle class suburbs of PG County where he was raised by divorced parents. Being a child of this arrangement had its turbulent times. Through his artistic abilities, C. Sleek found solace, but writing was not one of his skills at first. Initially he dove into sketching and painting and then eventually music production. It wasn&amp;#39;t until later in his life that he discovered that he enjoyed writing also. His passion for the pen came to him unannounced, at a low point in his life. It became another avenue for him to decompress, so he ran with it and has been in love with the arrangement of words ever since.&lt;/p&gt;" />
