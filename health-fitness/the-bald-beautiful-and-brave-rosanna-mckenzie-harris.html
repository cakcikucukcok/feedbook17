  <title>The Bald, Beautiful and Brave - Rosanna McKenzie Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born August 14, 1949 to Benjamin and Louise
McKenzie. She is the third of f ive siblings. She has
worked as a practical nurse for more than 37 years in the Miami
area. She has been as inspiration to many around her and in the
community. She is a dedicated Christian and desires one day to
open a facility for homeless girls and boys and unwed mothers.
Mrs. Harris believes this is just the beginning of how God will
use her as an instrument to do extraordinary measures for the
ordinary, to bring out the gifts and talents they possess.
Known as Mrs. Harris to some and Grandma to many, says
thank you for reading her book and be encouraged in f inding your
destiny. Its never about how old or young you are, its not about
the way you look or even your education. Its about a desire and
reaching to the sky, going the distance for your destiny.
