  <title>Women Conquering Depression - Susan Nolen-Hoeksema</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Women Who Think Too Much&lt;/i&gt;, a groundbreaking book that uncovers a hidden source of depression in women today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a common and debilitating problem among women, though it rarely occurs in a vaccum. As Susan Nolen-Hoeksema&#39;s original research shows, overthinking--a tendency to ruminate on problems rather than to seek solutions--often co-exists with unhealthy eating habits and/or heavy drinking. In fact, 80 percent of women who report suffering from one of those also suffer from another. This groundbreaking book, written in a vivid narrative style that captures the complexities of women&#39;s lives today, explains how the three core problems of the Toxic Triangle reinforce one another, wreaking havoc on women&#39;s emotional well-being, physical health, relationships, and careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escape is possible, Nolen-Hoeksema assures us, for those who are already aware that they suffer from a serious problem as well as for the hundreds of thousands of others who have not yet examined the role that bingeing and purging--on negative thoughts, food, or alcohol--plays in their lives. Nolen-Hoeksema shows women how to harness their emotional and interpersonal strengths to overcome the stress caused by a destructive relationship with food, alcohol, and overthinking so that they can fashion effective, healthier strategies for living the life they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
