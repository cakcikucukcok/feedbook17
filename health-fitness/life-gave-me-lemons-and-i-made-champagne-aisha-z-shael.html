      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What was behind the door &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;I kept seeing the image of a barn door, behind which I suspected there was incredible painand staggering truth.  By March 1992, I could no longer deny what was behind the door:  I had survived satanic ritual abuse.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You hold in your hands an unabashed and courageous account of a survivor&#39;s journey from trauma to transformation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Suffering from physical pain and increasing emotional anguish, Aisha was determined to reach the crux of both and heal her life.  As she relentlessly delved into her own mind for answers, the pursuit of truth brought her face to face with:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt; multifarious memories,&lt;br /&gt;
 multiple personalities and&lt;br /&gt;
 mystical experiences &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With candor, she has willingly revealed the sequence of events that resulted in a collapse of life as she had known it. Like a phoenix rising from its own ashes, she made a miraculous comeback. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Join her and walk through this amazing, life-altering journey. Notice how she transmuted incredibly painful experiences and discovered that there is always hidden wisdom within them.&lt;/P&gt;
