  <title>Personal Protection Training - Dr. Leonard M. Breure, Rob Pincus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some Comments from Lens Students
I want you to know that in my many years of being a student, you easily rank as the best teacher I have ever had. Your skill and patience has made me infinitely more comfortable with my weapons and myself. The next class you teach, I&#39;ll be there in a heartbeat. I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t have to be reminded of the multitude of people you have touched and the positive impact you have had on firearms training overall.
Bob Patridge
Len has taught me to effectively and safely use a handgun and rifle and for that I will always be grateful. I look forward to the time I spend once or twice a week under his instruction. Len has created a wide range of firearms training programs out of virtually nothing and trained a sizeable and competent cadre of firearms instructors who, like me, greatly respects the man. He is engaged with his students and always approachable. Students who have shot much longer than me comment on his great depth of knowledge and ability to improve their shooting. He clearly loves to teach the material and his enthusiasm is contagious. He has a great sense of humor and makes his classes a lot of fun. But in spite of all of this the safety of his students is always his first concern.
Dr. Noel Pillman, MD
I am a retired police officer and a former police firearms instructor for over 20 years. I have been to numerous firearms training classes over the years but have not had any instructors more professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated to what they do then Len Breure.
Maurice Merabella
&quot;Len was my first real &#39;tactical&#39; instructor a few years ago. He is a thorough, safe, and well versed instructor. His teaching style is unique in a way that clearly conveys lessons and makes them easy to understand for experienced shooters and novices alike. Len brings a wealth of prior &quot;been there, done that&quot; experience to the table that&#39;s an asset to his teaching, and is rarely found in many of the new instructors that have come to the arena since most states have enacted concealed carry laws. I continue to train with a variety of tactical instructors, and am always amazed by how much of the information Len taught me is still the foundation upon which I build.&quot;
Mike VanMeeteren
&quot;I have been fortunate enough to receive numerous training courses that were being taught by Len Breure. In my opinion, Len is one of the best in the business! It is very rewarding to be able to learn from someone who has the experience and knowledge to take tactical training to the next level.&quot;
Jim Bryant
I first meet Len while taking my Minnesota Concealed Carry Course in 2005. Since that time I have taken every course that Len teaches. In my opinion Len is the consummate professional, who teaches with passion and an incredible degree of knowledge. I would strongly urge anyone interested in personal protection to take Lens courses.
