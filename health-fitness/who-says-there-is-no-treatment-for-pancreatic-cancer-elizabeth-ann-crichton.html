  <title>Who Says There Is No Treatment for Pancreatic Cancer? - Elizabeth Ann Crichton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is generally seen to be a death sentence, and sadly for many, this is in fact so. The fear it engenders in the person and the confusion one feels is indescribable. It is also generally a fact that it is not an issue we have had to deal with, and so the options are confusing and limited in our minds, generally only confined to the medical model available and advised by beautiful and well-meaning doctors.
It was soon after she moved north of Sydney to start a new life in an ecovillage that Elizabeth was shocked to find she had a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer stage 2B and, after a major operation, chemotherapy, and an almost immediate recurrence of the tumor, was advised that no further treatment was available apart from palliative radiotherapy. At this point, she consulted Grace Gawler, who has invaluable knowledge of worldwide treatment options for the various cancer types, and so began a journey of recovery that took her to Japan for three months for immunotherapy treatment and proton beam therapy. In the book, she shares a very detailed personal account of her Japan experience in the form of emails sent home as she traveled the healing journey." />
