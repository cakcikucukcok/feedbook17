  <title>The Link - Ola A.T. Onikoyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is clear evidence of discontent and disconnection in the life of many individuals, resulting to lack and limitations. The population of the poor is increasing in the midst of plenty. The hardworking people have little or nothing to show for their effort. The rich also cry profusely for one need or another. 
Those who claim to be men of God have no general answer to the immediate needs of their congregation; all these are proofs of an urgent need for a more pragmatic approach to solving our numerous problems. We urgently require knowing what links us to solutions and what connects us to the main domain of power.
We are not totally impervious to the facts, but we need to get used to it. For instance, we know the air we breathe, but not all of us know the contents of this vitality of life. We know the mind, as in man, but many are ignorant of it as the powerhouse creative theater and the link to the spiritual mass where the creations and the Creator meet. 
We know the world, but many are yet to know that we are the world; we are the children of the most high God, so we should start giving what we want. If you need love, give it first. If you need wealth, give service. Whatsoever you need, be prepared to pay the price, and link it up with what you have. 
The world is a masterpiece of abundance. There is enough wealth to go round in the universe. Each and every one can be what he or she desires to be. All we need to know is how to link our inheritance, how to connect with our aspirations, and how to attract our yearnings. The eighty-two topics in this book will assist you to link up with yourself, connect with your God, and be able to attract solutions and the best things of life. Read passionately, keep thinking, and keep linking." />
