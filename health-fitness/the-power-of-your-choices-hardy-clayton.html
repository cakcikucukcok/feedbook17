  <title>The Power of Your Choices - Hardy Clayton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is an evolutionary process that is constantly taking us from one dimension of our lives to another. Thus, depending on how well or poorly we handle each phase or transition will determine our quality of life in general. It is in these transitional moments, when we are faced with having to make decisions, that we either set ourselves up for failure or success. In this book, the author explores the value of learning how to implement better decision-making processes that can ultimately change our lives and lead to making better life choices. It provides the tools needed to organize your thoughts in a cohesive manner that will lead to better decision-making. This road map will take you on a personal journey to self-discovery. You&amp;rsquo;ll be encouraged to look inward for answers to unresolved issues that may have hindered your decision-making ability. Along the way, you will be challenged to make frequent breaks for self-assessments, as well as self-reflection. These self-assessments will lead to life changes that navigate you in a direction toward positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
