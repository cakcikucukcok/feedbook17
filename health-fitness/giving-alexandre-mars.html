  <title>Giving - Alexandre Mars</title>

From Hong Kong to Paris to New York, he met numerous people passionate about making the world a better place, yet unsure of how to do so.

In this vital book, Mars not only tells the story of Epic and its new formula for &amp;#160;giving but redefines what it means to give and have purpose.
