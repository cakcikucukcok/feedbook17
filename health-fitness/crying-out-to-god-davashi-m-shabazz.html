  <title>Crying out to God - Davashi M. Shabazz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is for each of us to experience Gods love and Gods unfiltered passion for us, and that we learn God on a personal and intimate level. That we become proactive in seeking God and as a friend once said, Pursue the God that pursued you. 
My prayer is that as you read this book, the words will spark a deep desire within your heart, mind and soul to learn the truth about God. A desire to learn the truth about God, His love for you, His will, His purpose for your life, and so much more! I heard a minister say, Each generation has to find their own truth about God. Therefore, it is my continuous desire that we find our own personal truth in God and allow that truth to be our compass. 
This book is a tool for you to use daily. Read it, meditate on the word, write down your revelations because the real awakening is revealed once you go beyond the words on the following pages, dig deeper into the word of God and spend time in prayer. As you dig, I promise that you will see truths never seen before, and you will experience a revelatory flow from heaven that is just for you! 
Seek God.Pursue GodExperience God as you actively learn about His goodness, mercy and love." />
