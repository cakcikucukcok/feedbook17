  <title>CRACKING the Inheritance Code - Cindy Arledge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to discover what you don&amp;rsquo;t know to protect your family&amp;rsquo;s future...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in the midst of the greatest wealth transfer in the history of mankind. Sadly, up to 90% of these transfers will fail&amp;mdash;when failure is measured by loss of assets, destroyed relationships, and unnecessary upheaval for heirs. The majority of these failures are caused by &lt;strong&gt;unprepared heirs&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;who don&amp;rsquo;t communicate or trust each other.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes total sense, because until now, the missing link that prevents the two most common reasons for inheritance failure has been reserved for ultra-high-net-worth families. Most family leaders recognize the potential for drama, but don&amp;rsquo;t know there is a plan they can implement to protect their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, because my family was destroyed after my parents passed away in 2005. When I became a grandmother a few years ago, I discovered the secret to successful wealth transfer and supplemented our estate plan to protect my family. Had my parents had access to the information contained in this book, it could have saved our family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;CRACKING the Inheritance Code&lt;/em&gt;, you will discover the real problem and why traditional planning isn&amp;rsquo;t enough to protect your family, and the real solution to protect your family&amp;rsquo;s future. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a professional advisor helping clients, or a family leader who wants to positively impact future generations, the simple steps in this book will help you achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
