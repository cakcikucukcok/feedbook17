  <title>The &quot;Me&quot; Book - Jane Marin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Self-discovery begins with desiredesire to understand more about what makes us tick, to break from routine, to heal a hurt, to express ourselves in new ways, to explore our hopes and dreams. Identifying the objects of our desire is important, since our focus has great impact on our attitude and self-awareness, which in turn are directly related to our happiness. In &lt;i&gt;The Me Book: A Journey of Self-Discovery,&lt;/i&gt; author, healer, and life coach Jane Marin shows us how to use the combined art forms of journaling, painting, scrapbooking and collage to increase self-knowledge and self-confidence and improve our lives on physical, emotional and spiritual levels.
Marin developed the idea of &lt;i&gt;The Me Book&lt;/i&gt; while researching her familys history and coming to the realisation of how rewarding it was to discover more about her history and record her own life as well. She realised that using creativity in expressing herself was therapeutic and healing, bringing forth all her positive energies. Marin unearthed the history of the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; her, which gave way to life changes both large and small, changes that immediately increased her self-esteem, her health and her perception of her lifes purpose. 
These are changes any of us can make. All we need are the motivation to begin the journey and the desire to create something truly worthwhilesomething like our own true life." />
