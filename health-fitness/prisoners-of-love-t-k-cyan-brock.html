  <title>Prisoners of Love - T.K. Cyan-Brock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prisoners of Love 10th Anniversary edition is for the families and friends of the incarcerated and those who want to be supportive to someone going through this situation. It was written by families of the incarcerated with professional insights and advice on topics common to incarceration. Prisoners of Love is empowering but does not sugarcoat the reality of waiting for someone while they are incarcerated. It offers hope, inspiration, and how-to information designed to help the reader navigate through this often heartbreaking situation. Prisoners of Love will help you overcome obstacles and use this time to grow closer and grow better as individuals instead of let the system and situation break you down. When my fianc was sentenced to serve time in prison, I felt lost and alone. After reading Prisoners of Love, I realized that there was still hope for us. Prisoners of Love gave us the encouragement and guidance we needed to bring us through the most difficult time of our relationship.Margaret M. This is a wonderful book for the millions of people who have loved ones on the other side. I keep a copy by my bedside and refer to it when I need encouragement.Sharon, North Carolina T.K. Cyan-Brock is the founder of www.prisonersoflove.com a website helping the families of the incarcerated since 1996. She has filled the 10th Anniversary edition with even more information that has kept her own family and other families going during times of incarceration." />
