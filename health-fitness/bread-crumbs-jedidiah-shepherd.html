  <title>Bread Crumbs - Jedidiah Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In todays society of the hustle and bustle of busy life, we so often miss not only the greatest pleasures of life, but, also the greatest
lessons of life as well. We are forever submerged in an ocean of consciousness and possibility, however, this ocean of consciousness must exist within us as well, for it must in order for us to exist. Without taking the time that is essential to learning from these wonderful things, we can easily go from the craddle to the grave without ever experiencing the richest treasures in life which possess the power to immensely enhance our existence as well as the lives of others.&lt;p&gt;
It is the authors deepest and most sincere desire that the reader would not merely gaze upon the material superficially, but rather, take
the time necessary to meditate in all earnestness with the desire and purpose to reap the fullest benefits. When things are handed to us, though much appreciated, they simply do not possess the magnificent value and joy that comes from what one discovers for him or herself. Equivalent to digging up and discovering a wonderful treasure for yourself which now forever belongs to you, it is yours.&lt;p&gt;
Life is a gift that knows no equal, a gift which is clearly intended to be fully enjoyed. Taking time from our busy lives to notice the things that truly matter the most to us will enrich our life, our family, and our community. For those who perceive such grand truths bear full responsibility for sharing such profound knowledge with others, but most of all, we must bequeath these precious gems to our children for their greatest advantage." />
