  <title>All in One - Pastor David Marcel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The entire creation that God has created is all in one in the church. All in one in man means no matter where you come from, what you do and social background, religion, ethnicity, color, language rank, status, rich or poor, doctor or housekeeper, black or white, king or homeless, male or femalewe are all coming from one father and mother through birth. Adam lay with his wife, Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, &quot;With the help of the LORD, I have brought forth a man, and later, she gave birth to his brother, Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil (according to the book of Genesis 4:12). 
All in one in the soul is the destination of the saved into one place, and the destination of the lost is into another place. The Bible says that there are two kingdoms: the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness. Salvation comes only from the light of the Lord Jesus Christ, in other words, the God of Heaven and the earth. But perdition is from Lucifer, in other words, the devil and old serpent. Therefore, anyone who accepts Jesus Christ will be saved, and anyone who doesnt accept Jesus Christ will be lost. Only those who accept Jesus Christ will be saved. &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16). 
All in one in the Spirit, according to the book of Ecclesiastes 12:7, and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it. Our composite in all in one on earth is the body, the soul, and the spirit; but our composite in all in one in heaven is God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost. Even here on earth, we link the fate of our existence to this. Therefore, we walk in the spirit but not in carnality. We walk with the core of our existence, Jesus Christ, the Master of our salvationbut not with the destroyer and enemy the devil, Lucifer. That is why we walk by faith and not by sight. Our all in one on earth is our all in one in heaven because we have to do it right on earth to be recompensed in heavenso its all in one. Be advised that the entire content of this writing may not be 100 percent compatible to those whod rather turn religion into a comfort zone, and this is being addressed from the pews to the pulpit." />
