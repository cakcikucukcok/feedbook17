  <title>Taking Control - Shayne Hammond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;One freezing July night, the cold, hard, truth hit author Shayne Hammond like a freight train: no one was coming to his rescue. It was then that he realized that he already had the power to change his life. Until that point, Shaynes story had been one of frustration after frustration, as hopes and dreams were taken from him again and again.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;His school years were chaotic. His family moved frequently, and the constant change quickly manifested itself in stress, aggression, and average grades. The son of a professional boxer, he asked his father to train him. But success as a student fighter did not immediately translate to success in the professional ring. His body and ego battered, Shayne stepped back from another dream, defeated, worn out, exhausted, and dejected.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Looking for a fresh start to change his luck, he began a lifelong search for a career outside of the ring. Each venture started off with great excitement and potential, but eventually old patterns emerged. Not one to give up, Shayne dedicated himself to education, reading voraciously, digging deep within the Scriptures and other books.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All it took to turn his life around was a little faith in himself. And on one fateful, frigid night, the epiphany he prayed for happened. In that moment of clarity, he understood the mystery of his successes and his failures. He thinks they may be the answers to your mysteries as well. Are you ready to take control of your destiny too?&lt;/P&gt;" />
