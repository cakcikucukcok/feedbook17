      <meta name="description" content="Being the best version of yourself is not an objective that we can reach overnight. As a human being, we first have to accept that we aren&amp;rsquo;t perfect, and perfection will never be our truth. Being the best version of yourself is not about perfection but more about finding your true self.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The true self can only be found when we choose to remove the mask that we&amp;rsquo;ve been wearing for a long time. That mask comes with behaviors and wounds that only time and hard work can heal. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to face your shadows and bring to light the aspect of yourself that needs to heal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Never forget that human was never meant to be alone and do things on their own. We are social creatures that require a community to thrive. Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to seek help from experts or build a support network on encouraging and motivating you to grow" />
