In &lt;I&gt;Knowing Your Value&lt;/I&gt;, the prequel to her new book &lt;I&gt;Grow Your Value,&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author Mika Brzezinski takes an in-depth look at how women today achieve their deserved recognition and financial worth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Prompted by her own experience as co-host of &lt;I&gt;Morning Joe,&lt;/I&gt; Mika interviewed a number of prominent women across a wide range of industries on their experience moving up in their fields.
