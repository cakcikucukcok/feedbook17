  <title>Train the Brain to Hear - Jennifer L. Holland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Train the Brain to Hear was written by a parent and teacher for parents and teachers. The book provides explanations of the learning disabilities dysgraphia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyslexia and auditory processing disorder as well as the common areas that are affected by learning disabilities including short term memory, executive function and comprehension. The treatment program utilizes brain training and neuroplasticity techniques to encourage development of the connections in the brain that strengthen these skills. The techniques can also be used to work with those who have been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, traumatic brain injury or stroke. One of the most difficult things for a parent to hear is that there is something wrong with a child and that there is nothing that can be done to help him. That is what author Jennifer Holland and her husband Charles were told in 2001 when their oldest son was diagnosed with auditory processing disorder. This diagnosis was repeated in 2010 when their second son was diagnosed and again in 2013 when the diagnosis was confirmed in their fourth child. In Charles and Jennifer’s family, auditory processing disorder is a genetic condition inherited from Charles. Jennifer made it her mission to figure out how to help her own children succeed in the classroom and in life. This program will allow you to treat those who are learning disabled from the preschool and early reader age level through adulthood and understand and address many of the most common difficulties they face in everyday life. This book was written and the program developed for every parent who has been told there was nothing that could be done for their child and for every parent/teacher who knows more can be." />
