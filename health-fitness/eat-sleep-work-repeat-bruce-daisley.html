  <title>Eat Sleep Work Repeat - Bruce Daisley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;An important reminder of simple everyday practices to improve how we all work together, which will lead to greater team and individual happiness and performance.

Can a team&amp;#8217;s performance be improved simply by moving the location of the coffee maker? Why are meetings so often a waste of time, and how can a walking meeting actually get decisions made?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an executive with decades of management experience at top Silicon Valley companies including YouTube, Google, and Twitter, Bruce Daisley has given a lot of thought to what makes a workforce productive and what factors can improve the workplace to benefit a company&amp;#8217;s employees, customers, and bottom line. In his debut book, he shares what he&amp;#8217;s discovered, offering practical, often counterintuitive, insights and solutions for reinvigorating work to give us more meaning, productivity, and joy at the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Gallup survey of global workers revealed shocking news: only 13% of employees are engaged in their jobs. This means that burn out and unhappiness at work are a reality for the vast majority of workers. Managers&amp;#8212;and employees themselves&amp;#8212;can make work better. &lt;em&gt;Eat Sleep Work Repeat&lt;/em&gt; shows them how, offering more than two dozen research-backed, user-friendly strategies, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to Lunch (it makes you less tired over the weekend)&lt;br/&gt;Suggest a Tea Break (it increases team cohesiveness and productivity)&lt;br/&gt;Conduct a Pre-Mortem (foreseeing possible issues can prevent problems and creates a spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s start enjoying our jobs again,&amp;#8221; Daisley insists. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s time to rediscover the joy of work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;" />
