  <title>How I Found Peace - Lawnrence R. Beaty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You will love the stories of how God finally got his attention as he went through encounters with wild animals, was struck by lightning, went through killer tornadoes, had many encounters with snakes in the wild, etc.  He eventually was used by God in many ways which he shares with us as he and his wife ministered to other peoples children through Scouting, foster parenting, adopting abused children, and in church ministry.
He eventually was led to peace and because of his path to it he could use his experiences during his earlier life to minister to others that were hurting as he had been.  In the later years as God proved time and again of His love for Larry, God was able to utilize all of these stories through the different ministries to inmates in jails, hitch-hikers along the hi-ways, answering phones with the Billy Graham Telephone Ministry, and as he worked to slow down the cultural deterioration of our Nation.
If you or someone that you know has had a similar background of growing up under abuse, rejection, and anger, then as you read of Larrys stories, you can see how God was able to change him, and if you apply those things he was shown, you too can find peace.  You will laugh and cry as you see the struggles that he went through.  This book is worth the price just for the humor, but it is priceless for the life lessons that he shares with us.  May you also find peace." />
