  <title>Breathe, Sweep, and Sleep - Robert T. Rewick, Joy Haefs Rewick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you one of the millions worldwide who has trouble sleeping? Do the remedies you read about in books all seem alike, and are the treatments less effective as you age or your lifestyle changes? Are you not sleeping well because you cant clear your mind of disturbing thoughts while you are in bed? After receiving little help from current published sleep-help methods, Author and Research Scientist Robert T. Rewick, a long-time insomnia sufferer, decided to study his sleep problem from a visualization point of view. The result of his study is presented in this Guide, which offers a different approach to sleep mitigation than found in most current insomnia literature. Rewick wants to share his Guide with others who have trouble achieving a good nights rest. He has found that his techniques provide more consistent results than other methods he has tried. He predicts that his approach will also work for you. Rewicks method to help you achieve an improved sleeping pattern focuses on how to control non-productive mental activity in bed. His approach, described in 16 concise chapters, is based on clearing your mind with an innovative breathing technique he calls the Breath Sweep. Rewicks Guide is written in simple, understandable terms and includes schematic photos and illustrations to help you understand the principles behind his research. Ten Benefits You Will Receive From This Guide: 1. Learn why common sleep-help methods dont always work and become less effective as you age. 2. Find that most published sleep-aid techniques are virtually identical in the published literature. 3. Discover that not clearing your mind in bed is the number one obstacle to not falling asleep. 4. Learn the difference between your conscious and unconscious minds and how they affect your sleep. 5. Recognize the value of identifying the problems that disrupt your sleep. 6. Learn the importance of establishing a stabilized breathing pattern in bed. 7. Discover the Authors concept of the Breath Sweep, an effective technique for removing sleep-depriving problems from your mind while in bed. 8. Learn how to mentally transfer problems to an isolated holding spot while you sleep. 9. Study detailed photos and illustrations to help you understand the imagery the author proposes. 10. Appreciate the novel, scientific, and easy-to-understand techniques that work for the Author and he predicts will work for you." />
