  <title>What Is My Purpose? - Dr. Vijaya Chetty, Raynald Kudemus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for all parents: those who are pregnant, those who already are gifted with children and those future mothers and fathers just waiting for a special soul to make their life complete. For the latter, this book can be used daily for mediation and as a tool in asking for that special little person to choose us to be their parents. For those who have already been blessed with little ones, this book can be used as a valuable reminder for them as to who they are, where they are, and what their purpose in life is.
We are so busy reacting to external situations in our ever-changing world that we often forget who we really are, smothering ourselves in a blanket of stress and anxiety over things that dont really matter. The ever-observant child will learn to mimic how we deal with situations, carrying the same heavy blanket with them and can in turn lose track of what really matters, who they are and their real purpose in life. This book is about shedding those unnecessary layers to reveal our true selves so that through successful relationships we can share our love, happiness, peace, truth, and strength with each individual we come in to contact with.
Please do not underestimate the capabilities of a child. Whether he or she is  a teenager ,6 years old, a newborn baby or a young fetus, they all can hear us and they all feed off the love we show them. Every child, whatever their age, needs us to love them unconditionally, care for them and to be good role models.
Practice this by reading the book to your loved ones, wherever they may be.
I wish you the very best and I am grateful for this opportunity to share all my love, happiness, and strength with all the parents and children in this world, and beyond.
Dr. Vijaya Chetty" />
