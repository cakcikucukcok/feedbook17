      <meta name="description" content="Silence and stillness does have a magic to it. It doesn&#39;t matter where you find it — in your home, your workplace or your classroom. However in our fast-paced world it is getting harder and harder to find. In this book, one of Australia’s favourite parenting authors and educators Maggie Dent explores the cognitive and emotional benefits of silence and stillness, demonstrating how crucial it is for children as well as adults, and details methods for creating it in your home or classroom.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;About Maggie:&lt;br /&gt;Commonly known as the ‘queen of common sense’, Maggie Dent has become one of Australia&#39;s favourite parenting authors and educators, with a particular interest in the early years, adolescence and resilience.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie’s experience includes teaching, counselling, and working in palliative care/funeral services and suicide prevention. She is a dedicated advocate to quietly changing lives in our families and communities. She is the mother of four sons and a very grateful grandmother.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Maggie is the author of 11 books including her 2018 release &lt;i&gt;Mothering Our Boys&lt;/i&gt; which is already a bestseller." />
