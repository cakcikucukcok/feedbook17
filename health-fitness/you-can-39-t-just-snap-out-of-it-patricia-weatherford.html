  <title>You Can&#39;t Just Snap out of It - Patricia Weatherford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One night, I was on the floor, facedown, praying before the Lord, when I felt like God was enveloping me in his arms. I had just come out of a six-month depression. I heard him speak to my heart, and he told me that he wanted me to write a book on what it looks like, feels like, and what it is to be in a depressed person&#39;s body. 
My purpose in writing this book is to help educate people about this debilitating disease so that they can become more compassionate and supportive of their loved ones, friends, coworkers, and depressed people in general. If you have never experienced depression personally, it is difficult to understand and hard to relate to.
I found out in talking to many people that mental illness touches almost every family. There are so many suicides that are taking place in our world today. That is why it is so important to arm yourselves with the knowledge of the signs and symptoms of depression so that you can get that person help.
In the book, &quot;You Can&#39;t Just Snap out of It,&quot; there is also a message of hope. You don&#39;t have to suffer in silence any longer. There is help out there for you. All you have to do is ask." />
