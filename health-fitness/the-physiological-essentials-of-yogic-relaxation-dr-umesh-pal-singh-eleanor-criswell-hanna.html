  <title>The Physiological Essentials of Yogic Relaxation - Dr. Umesh Pal Singh, Eleanor Criswell Hanna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book lays special emphasis on the fact that the application of natural physical factors is most expedient. Written in a simple, direct, but adept manner, it is a beautiful introductory book. The focus is really to help the reader learn the basic concepts and understandings behind how the yogic relaxation techniques work and then to get them into practice.
In conclusion, I wish to note with great satisfaction that this book, which is compiled and edited by a mainstream health professional and a seasoned yoga practitioner, is expected to reveal the physiological essentials of yogic relaxation from contemporary viewpoint. The author has integrated in a beautiful fashion a bewildering and diverse scientific literature into an organized and a compelling presentation." />
