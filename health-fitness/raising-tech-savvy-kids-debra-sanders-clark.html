  <title>Raising Tech Savvy Kids - Debra Sanders Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p.Advances in technology have improved our lives significantly. These advances have surely altered the way we learn, socialize, entertain, shop and execute business. Between home, work and school, we now have access to technology a greater portion of the day. In some cases, this access is constant and continuous. While technology has its benefits, used improperly, it can produce shocking results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to research, there are 50,000 predators online at any given time (Thomas, n.d.). These individuals are likely luring profiles or hiding in chat rooms in search of vulnerable children. Predators know that a growing number of children are now on the Internet, therefore, they monopolize the opportunity because it allows easy access and increased chances to privately communicate with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, predators are not the only threat online. According to research there are over 5 million Facebook users under the age of 10, although Facebook prohibits users under the age of 13, (Hopkinson, 2015). In addition, there are over 80 million fake profiles on Facebook (Chauhan, 2016). With the increase accessibility of social media, criminals often create fake profiles online to capitalize on the opportunity to steal more than identity. Parents, beware! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence of the many hidden dangers online, parents should be concerned and learn ways to increase youth safety. This self-help manuscript will provide information to help parents help their children have a safe and rewarding Internet experience. Readers will receive the following benefits: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;explore the pros and cons of technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn techniques for proper usage of modern technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gain knowledge of potential risks such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;cyberbullying, sexting, predators, exploitation and others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn about secret apps and codes children use to hide their online activities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;acquire knowledge to implement safety online&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;implement and explain the rules for computer and Internet usage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;develop a trusting relationship to improve parent and child communication risk, safety and responsibilities&lt;/p&gt;
