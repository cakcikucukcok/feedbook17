  <title>Manifesting in Alignment with Soul - Anina Davenport</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of &lt;I&gt;Manifesting in Alignment with Soul&lt;/I&gt; is to help you to co-create with the universe with more ease and joy. You do not create alone. There is a whole universe out there ready to help and support you on your path. The book focuses on creating Highest Good, which means that sometimes you are not sure what you are creating, or what your true Self wants you to participate in. This becomes clearer as you take the first steps and keep intending Highest Good. There are practical examples and discussions of obstacles on the way; and throughout the book we remind you to be loving and gentle with yourself. You can achieve much more with ease and relaxation than with force and extreme effort although at times and in emergencies that might be necessary. We want you to come more into a flow where creation just happens. Your job is to check your beliefs and make sure that you are not working against yourself or your true Self. Our job is to remind you gently when you have become stuck in a rut or pattern and help you to get out of it. The book contains certain energies and can be picked up at random if you feel you need some help. Our love is with you.&lt;/P&gt;
