      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Erotic Love and Marriage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is written for couples who are searching to establish or restore a fulfilling sexual relationship and a meaningful and gratifying connection. Using history, everyday life situations, and careful analysis, Frederick Mondin makes the case for liberation from the fear, guilt, and shame that mark so much of human sexuality. He offers insight on sexual issues almost everyone struggles with in their relationships and promotes a healthier approach that highlights connection, communication, and exploration. Including an exploration of the role of religion and culture in shaping sexual attitudes and behaviors, he offers guidelines for establishing a healthier outlook on and understanding of sexual choices and desires. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Intended to help the many couples struggling to break free of negative scripts, inhibition, fear, guilt, and shame surrounding intimacy and sexual connection, he offers real life examples and solutions that will help readers enjoy a closer more meaningful sexual and emotional relationship with their partners. Couples will learn how to improve their sexual experience by understanding male sexual functioning and female orgasm. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Erotic Love and Marriage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; also explores what role pornography, infidelity, masturbation, sexual addiction, erotica, romance, and emotional connections play in a couple&amp;rsquo;s affairs. Mondin&amp;rsquo;s insights provide a positive and nurturing perspective that inspires and instructs in a way that leaves couples feeling more secure, grounded, and connected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
