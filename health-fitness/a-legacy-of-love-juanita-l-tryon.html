  <title>A Legacy of Love - Juanita L. Tryon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Legacy of Love is the story of a Southern Indiana farm family and the trials and tribulations of raising children during the Great Depression Era. This family, like most people during this era who lived in agricultural communities, did not have central heat, electricity nor indoor bathrooms. Most farm families raised (or made) most of their own food including chickens, eggs, butter, milk, beef, pork, and vegetables from their own gardens. They relied on each other, their extended families, neighbors, and their church community to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ora and Ann Wolfe raised seven children who became productive adults, on 64 acres of land (of which 30 were not tillable) in a three room clapboard house. Supplemental income came from intermittent work in the coal mines by Ora and the selling of butter and eggs by Ann to stores in the city and to neighbors who did not have their own. They faced personal challenges with the loss of a young child to scarlet fever, years where farming efforts barely produced enough to feed them all and family members who left the nest to go off to war or to work in the factories, or elsewhere, to support the war effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day was a challenge, but their belief that an all wise God ruled the affairs of mankind kept the family grounded in its Christian Faith. Church was the center for community and social life. Sunday services, church potluck dinners and singing in the churchs Glee Club were activities enjoyed by this family. The strict observance of the Sabbath was celebrated with a large dinner served around the noon hour that would be enjoyed by every family member and often, with friends of the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Legacy of Love will provide the reader with an understanding of life in America during difficult economic times - a time when many people lost hope and some left their homes and farms, never to return. Others gained strength though family, hard work and their churches. The average farm family had little or no money, but nearly everyone faced similar challenges. Adults and children alike learned ways to enjoy the simple things in life at practically no cost. These difficult times not only instilled a good work ethic in children but a strong commitment to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This commitment is the legacy of love that bound this family so tightly together with a rich family heritage. It is the fabric that builds strong communities.&lt;/p&gt;" />
