  <title>Dear Patrick: Life Is Tough--Here&#39;s Some Good Advice - Jeffrey M. Schwartz, Annie Gottlieb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear Patrick,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five years I have been witness to your struggles to grow up without a father. As a family friend, I can&#39;t make that up to you. What I can do is stand by you, and teach you how to be the kind of man you wish your father had been ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins the correspondence of two unlikely friends, Patrick Buckley, a sixteen-year-old New York City high schooler, and Jeffrey M. Schwartz, internationally renowned neuroscientist and the critically acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Brain Lock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Mind and the Brain&lt;/em&gt;. Inspired by Patrick&#39;s straight forward questions, Schwartz examines the moral teachings of our greatest spiritual leaders -- Jesus, Buddha, and Moses -- and filters them through the lens of his cutting-edge psychiatric research, as well as his own experiences of childhood loneliness and loss. With fierce certainty and love, Schwartz provides Patrick with a blueprint for breaking free from the culture of corrosive cynicism that threatens to destroy him, and for constructing a decent, meaningful, and fulfilling life. The result is a fascinating and revolutionary new code for living born of a man and a boy who sought honor and self-command in a culture of self-indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
