  <title>Parkinson’S Plus - Evelyn Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;When Evelyn Walsh was diagnosed with Early Onset Parkinsons Plus, her world came screeching to a halt.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She suddenly found everything she valued the most was being taken awayher freedom, her health, and her confidence. As things got worse, she thought the unthinkable: Might she even lose her ability to communicate?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Her left arm would constantly engage in alien movements; it had a mind of its own. She injured herself on multiple occasions, and would often think about strapping the arm down so she wouldnt have to deal with its unwelcome consequences.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this honest account, she shares her feelings about being diagnosed as well as the problems she faced, how she overcame some of them, and how she learned to accept others. She also shares what shes learned about Corticobasal Degeneration, which was deemed the most likely cause of many of her issues.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whether youre seeking to learn from someone whos also battling Parkinsons, want to support a loved one whos coping with the disease, or want to understand the complicated health issues associated with the condition, youll discover important truths in &lt;i&gt;Parkinsons Plus.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
