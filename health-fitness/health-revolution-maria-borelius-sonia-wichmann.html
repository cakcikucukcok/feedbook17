  <title>Health Revolution - Maria Borelius, Sonia Wichmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of one woman&amp;#8217;s unique, four-year-long quest to banish melancholy and depression, find happiness and fulfillment, cultivate wellness, and ultimately create her best self&amp;#8212;lessons anyone can use to pursue a healthier and more satisfied life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Maria Borelius turned fifty-two, she hit menopause and her physical health began to decline. Feeling tired, sad, and depressed, she suffered from physical pain, including a lingering back ache. Fearful that this was a glimpse of what the future would be, she embarked on a personal odyssey, an exploratory journey that introduced her to a whole new style of living that would transform her body, mind, and soul &amp;#8211; an anti-inflammatory lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria began with science. She traveled the globe to meet medical and fitness experts in Canada, the United States, Denmark, India, and Sweden. She studied history, exploring the health secrets of ancient civilizations and religious sects with unexpected long life-spans. What she discovered helped her turn back her clock and find renewed energy, enthusiasm, and joy. She changed her eating habits, making plants the center of her diet. She got her body moving to strengthen her muscles and stimulate her mind. She also opened herself to the possibilities of the world around her, cultivating a sense of awe and wonder and an appreciation for glorious sunsets and more of the priceless beauty life offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Revolution&lt;/em&gt; is the fascinating chronicle of one woman&amp;#8217;s quest for knowledge and her desire to foster physical, mental, and spiritual wellness. Filled with inspiring and calming imagery and illustrations, this energizing motivational guide includes concrete and doable tips and recipes for everyone who wants to experience a stronger, happier, and more youthful version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
