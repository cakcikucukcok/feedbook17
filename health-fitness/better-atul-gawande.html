But nowhere is this drive to do better more important than in medicine, where lives are on the line with every decision. In his new book, Atul Gawande explores how doctors strive to close the gap between best intentions and best performance in the face of obstacles that sometimes seem insurmountable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gawande&#39;s gripping stories of diligence, ingenuity, and what it means to do right by people take us to battlefield surgical tents in Iraq, to labor and delivery rooms in Boston, to a polio outbreak in India, and to malpractice courtrooms around the country. He discusses the ethical dilemmas of doctors&#39; participation in lethal injections, examines the influence of money on modern medicine, and recounts the astoundingly contentious history of hand washing. And as in all his writing, Gawande gives us an inside look at his own life as a practicing surgeon, offering a searingly honest firsthand account of work in a field where mistakes are both unavoidable and unthinkable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At once unflinching and compassionate, &lt;i&gt;Better&lt;/i&gt; is an exhilarating journey narrated by &quot;arguably the best nonfiction doctor-writer around&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Salon&lt;/i&gt;). Gawande&#39;s investigation into medical professionals and how they progress from merely good to great provides rare insight into the elements of success, illuminating every area of human endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
