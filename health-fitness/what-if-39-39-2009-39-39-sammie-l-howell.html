Its no main characters in this novel because everybody has a What if situation to go through. Someone gets shot, someone gets involved in a serious relationship, and someone finds God even when they werent looking for him and someone gets pregnant without sleeping with a man. Its gonna be some serious situations that the average person who has God in their lives wouldnt want to read this because of the explicit content in this book, but we all were born in sin and aint nothing new under the sun. So give it a chance because it could be somebody you know, what if it was you!" />
