  <title>Your Road Map to Success - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having a sense of purpose in life goes a long way to helping you feel confident, secure and happy. A sense of purpose can be brought about by anything in life: it can be related to your career, bringing up a family or doing voluntary work. It is all about fitting in and feeling you are making a difference in life, that you are achieving something and getting somewhere.   If you have a sense of purpose in life, you have something to look forward to everyday, a reason for getting up out of bed in the morning with a smile, it makes you feel good on the outside and so good on the inside. It leads to a more confident person who is happy with their position in life.  Younger people very often have no problem developing a purpose in life, they are just starting out and the majority of them have exams to pass, careers to start building, meeting the opposite sex, dating, marrying and eventually starting their own families." />
