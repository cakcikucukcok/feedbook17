  <title>Maximum Strength Parenting - Andrew Vaughan, Lauren Resnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the town of Maximum Strength Parenting, a happy little place where youll have a lot to do, a lot to think about, and a lot of fun!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maximum Strength Parenting is the art of using all of your gifts and knowledge in the most important and influential job you will ever have, parenting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Maximum Strength Parent helps foster the growth of a Maximum Strength Child, which is a child who enjoys the process of striving to his or her potential and acts with courage, consistency, responsibility, power, authority, flexibility, sound judgment, and humanity in his or her emotional, intellectual, spiritual, moral, and physical interactions with the world.   
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maximum Strength Parenting is the greatest gift you can give your child.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Maximum Strength Parenting we express our Freedom of Speech and our Freedom to Teach, but we stop well-short of the Freedom to Preach that is evident in so many parent-advice books of the day.  Throughout Maximum Strength Parenting you will find rich information, balanced commentary, and consideration of nuanced points that will cause you to think more deeply about your positions (or perhaps re-think your positions) on countless topics of philosophical and practical importance in parenting.  We also provide broad ranges of effective parenting strategies for you to choose from.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Throughout these pages we have provided hundreds of little bits of insight, encouragement, strategy, inspiration, and solution options.  From our hearts to yours, we hope you will find the ideas and strategies in Maximum Strength Parenting to be worthy companions on your lifelong journey of raising a Maximum Strength Child.
