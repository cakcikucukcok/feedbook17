  <title>Into the Mist - Deborah Uetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Into the Mist, When Someone You Love Has Alzheimers Disease&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; answers the questions that come along with an Alzheimers diagnosis.   As Alzheimers reaches epidemic proportion more and more families are searching for answers that will best equip them to meet their needs and those of the Alzheimers patient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What are the symptoms of the early stages of Alzheimers disease? &lt;br&gt;
When should someone stop driving?&lt;br&gt;
Why is my loved one becoming withdrawn and insecure?&lt;br&gt;
Are hallucinations an occurrence with Alzheimers disease?&lt;br&gt;
Does Medicare or Medicaid cover expenses?&lt;br&gt;
How do I cope with the stress of constant care giving?&lt;br&gt;
Is Alzheimers disease fatal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Many other topics are addressed by leading Aging experts, researchers and a Neuropsychologist.
Along with factual information the reader will be told the stories of three families caring for a loved one from the earliest stages to the last stages.  Their personal accounts put a human face on the challenges of Alzheimers care giving.  Jack, Frank and Shirleys stories are told by their daughters  and they illustrate the commonalities and the differences among Alzheimers patients and the way their families handle their most difficult challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The book began as a personal journal but grew into a comprehensive resource for Alzheimers caregivers as well as a compilation of information from researchers, psychologists, Aging experts and  families coping with this devastating illness all over the world.  As you walk into the mist of Alzheimers disease this book serves as a roadmap because of the life lessons of others who have traveled this road before you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
