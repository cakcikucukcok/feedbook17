  <title>Refuge Recovery - Noah Levine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author and renowned Buddhist teacher Noah Levine adapts the Buddha&#39;s Four Noble Truths and Eight Fold Path into a proven and systematic approach to recovery from alcohol and drug addiction&amp;#8212;an indispensable alternative to the 12-step program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many desperately need the help of the 12-step recovery program, the traditional AA model&#39;s focus on an external higher power can alienate people who don&#39;t connect with its religious tenets. &lt;em&gt;Refuge Recovery&lt;/em&gt; is a systematic method based on Buddhist principles, which integrates scientific, non-theistic, and psychological insight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewing addiction as cravings in the mind and body, Levine shows how a path of meditative awareness can alleviate those desires and ease suffering. &lt;em&gt;Refuge Recovery&lt;/em&gt; includes daily meditation practices, written investigations that explore the causes and conditions of our addictions, and advice and inspiration for finding or creating a community to help you heal and awaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practical yet compassionate, Levine&#39;s successful Refuge Recovery system is designed for anyone interested in a non-theistic approach to recovery and requires no previous experience or knowledge of Buddhism or meditation. &lt;/p&gt;" />
