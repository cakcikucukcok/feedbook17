  <title>Stories of Creativity, Women, Work and Wealth - Asma Baig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about women and their positions in businesses in the early twenty-first century. It is a study about how womens thoughts and behaviours, the society, organisations and necessity affects their work, lives and careers. 
The research conducted has investigated the gradual increase of women as business leaders and the factors that encourage this rise. This was done mainly through primary research using questionnaires and interviews. 
The research findings are divided into personal characteristics of women, societal characteristics that help create them and organisational characteristics that sustain and promote women in work and leadership. Through determining the causes that encourage certain women to pursue leadership positions in businesses, this research has outlined some ways how more women can aspire to take on leading roles. 
The qualitative research also generated ideas such as help to women when career breaks become necessary for family reasons and the help available on returning back to work. The findings show that more work needs to be done on understanding the value of contribution that women can bring to businesses, in this modern age. 
The Creativity section highlights the use of our minds and our imagination when we need answers to problems, help from the forces of this universe and divine guidance." />
