  <title>How to build your relationship very strong with your loved one - Pharable</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; What is life? Why we are here What I have experienced is that I am here to learn, give, and receive love.&lt;br /&gt;
I am here to serve others.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; When it comes to giving and receiving love in life, what&amp;#39;s the point of having a relationship with someone, falling in love, having a broken heart, with challenges, problems, obstacles, pain, sadness, sadness, regrets, etc. to treat? Life teaches us to find love in ourselves, to keep our hearts open, and to know that the best is yet to come.&lt;br /&gt;
If the situation in life does not find its way, if you put it in perspective and see it as a larger whole, you will see that there is a reason behind everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There is one particular lesson you should learn from all of your life experiences. All life experiences teach you to find your true self. All life experiences teach you to love yourself, accept, trust, and forgive yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
All life experiences teach you to open your heart to love.&lt;br /&gt;
What do you do if your heart is broken, injured, or disappointed? Some of us cling to the fact that we are afraid of being hurt again. Some of us can continue without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There are at least ten ways to open your heart again. I practiced it and I want to share it with you.&lt;br /&gt;
