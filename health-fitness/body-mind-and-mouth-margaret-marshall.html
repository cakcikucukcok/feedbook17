  <title>Body, Mind, and Mouth - Margaret Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most people understand that they are in control of what and how they eat. Unfortunately, there can be a daily disconnect regarding ones body, mind, and mouth, very often lasting for years. In this guide, author Margaret Marshall uses insights and lessons from her clients lives, along with her own experiences, to address the challenges we often face controlling our weight. She asks you to consider the unpleasant and sometimes life-threatening circumstances we accept in our lives instead of taking responsibility for our well-being. &lt;br /&gt;
Among the real stories she shares in Body, Mind, and Mouth is the story of a New York City police officer who no longer fits into his bulletproof vest. He closes it tightly on his right side leaving a gap on his left side, knowing to face right if he is ever in a shoot-out. Also included is the story of a working mother and her son, who became increasingly heavier due to her busy life and the ease of obtaining fast food. These and other stories illustrate how our minds affect our mouths, how our mouths affect our bodies, and how a shift in thought can benefit our health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Marshall uses humor and real stories to demonstrate her vast knowledge of nutrition and psychology in the weight-loss field. She brings to the book the same enthusiasm and knowledge she does in her speaking. Her message is clear, well written, and motivating. Imagine a book that is easy to read and packed with good information. Now thats a real deal.&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Harris R. Cohen, author of&lt;br /&gt;
Lessons Learned: How to Negotiate&lt;br /&gt;
