Along the way, Kohl wrestles with a new world of medical ethics: Should she &quot;selectively reduce&quot; the number of embryos successfully implanted in the womb in order to prevent a potentially complicated pregnancy? How much genetic testing of fertilized eggs is too much? What is she supposed to do with the seven embryos left over from the IVF process?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Andrew Solomon wrote &lt;i&gt;The Noonday Demon&lt;/i&gt;, he opened the world of depression to readers as no writer had done before. And when Stephen L. Carter wrote &lt;i&gt;Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby&lt;/i&gt;, many readers were forced to completely rethink race and prejudice. Kohl&#39;s spirited and rich exploration of &quot;embryo culture&quot; will completely revise how we see modern motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
