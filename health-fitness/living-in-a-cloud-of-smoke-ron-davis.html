  <title>Living in a Cloud of Smoke - Ron Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe you will be inspired as you read this detailed account of
what Ron went through, from a young age, where he tells how he planted a
seed in his life that would eventually come back to haunt him and his health.
You will be moved, as he tells about coming down with emphysema, and
inspired as you read how God moved time and time again, receiving not one
lung, but two. You will not want to lay this book down. Read and see how
God blessed Him, after his transplant, giving him a beautiful voice to sing.
He mentions in the book how he travels singing and sharing about his
addiction, deliverance, and miraculous transplant." />
