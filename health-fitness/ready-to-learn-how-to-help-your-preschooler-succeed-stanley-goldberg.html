  <title>Ready to Learn: How to Help Your Preschooler Succeed - Stanley Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you tell your preschooler one thing and they do the opposite? Are they easily distracted or unable to focus? If you suspect that your child may have a learning problem--or if you simply want to help them be ready--here is the book to read before he or she enters the school system: a realistic, humorous, and kind-hearted guide to helping your little one learn.  In Ready to Learn, Stan Goldberg draws on thirty years of clinical experience (and personal experience as the father of two kids with learning differences) to provide an easy-to-use guide to helping children overcome any problems and improve their learning skills. Illustrating his discussion with many anecdotes about teaching both his own children and children in his private practice, Goldberg walks readers through the process of learning and shows how to identify a learning problem. He focuses on four major areas--problems of attention, understanding, storage, and retrieval--presenting each problem through the eyes of the child, in everyday terms that a parent can understand. He looks at seven down-to-earth strategies that will allow you to create the best plan to help your child overcome their problem and he provides many handy charts and figures that will help you organize your efforts. The book also includes a list of useful web sites and a chart of development milestones, outlining motor skills, cognitive-sensory skills, and language and social skills.  Written in a style that blends humor, insightful stories, and practical experience, Ready to Learn provides a flexible, time-tested approach, using step-by-step strategies that will help your preschoolers become confident and love learning--before they enter the classroom." />
