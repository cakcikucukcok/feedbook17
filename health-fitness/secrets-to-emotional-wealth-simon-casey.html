      <meta name="description" content="Secrets to Emotional Wealth explores the critical importance that connecting with and processing feelings has on our ability to achieve happiness, love, and meaning in our lives.  It also describes the six core feelings and explores how the way in which how we learn to come to terms with these feelings during our early lives results in creating defenses to avoid facing feelings. It also explores the importance of the beliefs that we establish early in life, based on conclusions we draw from both information and experience, many of which are false.  These beliefs are reinforced as time goes on, distorting our core selves, and creating a false reality that is inconsistent with our basic nature. Secrets to Emotional wealth shows that we each possess within ourselves the ability to be truly happy, the gaining of a higher level of consciousness, and the powerful realization that we are indeed the architects of our own reality." />
