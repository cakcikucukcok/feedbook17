  <title>Building Your Child&#39;s Self-Esteem - Yvonne Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem is your sense of personal worth. It encompasses both self-confidence and self-acceptance. In part, healthy self-esteem comes from your awareness of the value you add to your family and the community. In &lt;i&gt;Building Your Childs Self-Esteem&lt;/i&gt;, author Yvonne Brooks provides a step-by-step guide for improving childrens self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical and hands-on, with clear and concise instructions, &lt;i&gt;Building Your Childs Self-Esteem&lt;/i&gt; shows parents how to identify healthy and low self-esteem behaviors in their children. Parents will also learn how to overcome and correct unproductive habits that limit their childs performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From developing a series of ideas for empowering children toward self-responsibility and awareness, parents will get the information needed to activate their childs potential for maximum success. Parents will learn how self-esteem manifests in children, how children with healthy and low self-esteem communicate, and how healthy and low self-esteem characteristics affect parenting skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Building Your Childs Self-Esteem&lt;/i&gt; provides guidance to help parents manifest and produce healthy, confident, courageous children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
