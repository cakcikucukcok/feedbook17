  <title>Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Myalgic Encephalitis Second Edition - Sarah Myhill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since its publication in April 2014, Dr Myhill’s guide to understanding and overcoming CFS/ME has become a must-read for sufferers from this poorly understood condition, but in that time both new research and new clinical findings have thrown further light onto an illness that for sufferers is life-stopping but for many doctors is ‘all in the mind’. Dr Myhill has revised, updated and expanded her original book to include new insights throughout and new chapters on: Why CFS is the worst treated condition in Western medicine; The roadmap to recovery; The fermenting gut; Allergy and autoimmunity; Lyme disease and other co-infections; Reprogramming the immune system; Reprogramming the brain; and Appendices on Probiotics, the Bell CFS ability scale and Welfare benefits. At the heart of the book remains the issue of mitochondrial failure – what this is, what it means for patients and what can be done to put it right." />
