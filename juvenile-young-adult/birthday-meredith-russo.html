  <title>Birthday - Meredith Russo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Lovers who surmount the odds have always been intense emotional fodder, but rarely have we seen a story like &lt;i&gt;Birthday&lt;/i&gt;...true and raw, haunting and undeniable.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two best friends. A shared birthday. Six years...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ERIC: &lt;/b&gt;There was the day we were born. There was the minute Morgan and I decided we were best friends for life. The years where we stuck by each other&#39;s side--as Morgan&#39;s mom died, as he moved across town, as I joined the football team, as my parents started fighting. But sometimes I worry that Morgan and I won&#39;t be best friends forever. That there&#39;ll be a day, a minute, a second, where it all falls apart and there&#39;s no turning back the clock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;MORGAN: &lt;/b&gt;I know that every birthday should feel like a new beginning, but I&#39;m trapped in this mixed-up body, in this wrong life, in Nowheresville, Tennessee, on repeat. With a dad who cares about his football team more than me, a mom I miss more than anything, and a best friend who can never know my biggest secret. Maybe one day I&#39;ll be ready to become the person I am inside. To become her. To tell the world. To tell Eric. But when?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years of birthdays reveal Eric and Morgan&#39;s destiny as they come together, drift apart, fall in love, and discover who they&#39;re meant to be--and if they&#39;re meant to be together. From the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;If I Was Your Girl&lt;/i&gt;, Meredith Russo, comes a heart-wrenching and universal story of identity, first love, and fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Beautifully written, &lt;i&gt;Birthday&lt;/i&gt; is an altogether singular contribution to the gradually growing body of transgender literature and, indeed, to mainstream literature, as well.&quot; --ALA &lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
