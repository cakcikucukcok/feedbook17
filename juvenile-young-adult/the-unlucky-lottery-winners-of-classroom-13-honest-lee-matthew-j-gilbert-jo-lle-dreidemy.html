  <title>The Unlucky Lottery Winners of Classroom 13 - Honest Lee, Matthew J. Gilbert, Joëlle Dreidemy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;As heard by kids everywhere on the Echo Dot Kids Edition, the Classroom 13 books are a hilarious new chapter book series-perfect for reluctant readers and fans of Roald Dahl, Captain Underpants, and Sideways Stories from Wayside School.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;The Unlucky Lottery Winners of Classroom 13&lt;/i&gt; is the first title in a series about the students of a very unlucky classroom. The easy-to-read chapters are full of humor, action, secret codes, and fun-and will prompt hours of conversation among friends, families, and classmates. The final chapter encourages young readers to write their own chapter and send it in to the author, Honest Lee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When unlucky teacher Ms. Linda LaCrosse wins the lottery, she shares her winnings with her class-giving each student over a BILLION DOLLARS!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  You might think this was nice, but it was not. It was a nasty idea. With great money comes awful allergies, terrible taxes, violent volcanoes, and other pesky problems. As the students of Classroom 13 are about to learn, winning the lottery is not always lucky." />
