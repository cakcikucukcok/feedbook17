  <title>The Dragons of Dorado - Vol. 1 The kidnapping - Danielle Dumais, David Spivock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On this 31st day of August in the 150th year of
Wilbras the 1st’s reign, a magician by the name of
Exir was calmly remembering how his country used
to be, a powerful and prosperous country called
Dorado, when he spotted a gigantic and particularly
dark cloud lingering around Princess Launa’s castle.
Had the Invaders returned ? Was the protective dome
compromised ? His blood flowed ice cold.
THIS IS HOW THE ADVENTURE BEGINS for Andrick,
when his father reveals the existence of a secret dragon,
a live specimen of those creatures they believed were
invented to liven up conversations.
Suddenly driven by curiosity, Andrick decides to set
out on his own in search of Infera, the dragon of the
lost legend. His twin sister Nina, himself and the entire
community of enchanters will face many obstacles
as well as completely unexpected, heart-wrenching
events.
Don’t miss out the next Dragon’s sequel !
Part 2 : The Ransom" />
