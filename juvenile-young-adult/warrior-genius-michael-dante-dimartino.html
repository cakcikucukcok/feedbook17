Fans will be thrilled with this new adventure!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Supreme Creator Nerezza has used fear and violence to rule her empire, seeking to eradicate anyone with a Genius. Then, twelve-year-old Giacomo emerged from hiding and joined a young generation of fellow artists paired with Geniuses. Together, they began a rebellion against her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Giacomo has something Nerezza desperately wants--the Compass, one of three powerful objects known as the Sacred Tools. Possessing all three would allow Nerezza to spread her tyranny worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a near-fatal showdown, Giacomo and his friends escape to the empire of Rachana, a society long feared for its mighty warriors and their horse-Geniuses. But a dark and ancient force threatens the horse-Geniuses with extinction, and Giacomo discovers he is the only one who can stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of his Genius and great friends, Giacomo struggles to keep the Sacred Tools from falling into the wrong hands and find a way to protect the Rachanan people--before Nerezza finds him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
