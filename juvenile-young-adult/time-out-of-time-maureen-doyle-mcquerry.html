  <title>Time out of Time - Maureen Doyle McQuerry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Beyond the Door&lt;/I&gt;, the first in the Time Out of Time duet from Maureen Doyle McQuerry, weaves a compelling coming-of-age story with fantasy and mythology. With his love of learning and the game of Scrabble, Timothy James feels like the only person who understands him is his older sister, Sarah, and he&amp;rsquo;s fairly certain nothing interesting will ever happen to him. But one night, while his parents and sister are away, the door opens, and mythical creatures appear in his own living room! Soon, a mystery of unparalleled proportions begins to unfold, revealing an age-old battle of Light against Dark, and Timothy must embark on a quest to prevent the Dark from controlling the future and changing the past. But he can&amp;rsquo;t complete the quest alone. Timothy has to team up with his sister and the school bully, Jessica, to face an ancient evil, and in the process, this unlikely trio discover they are each more than meets the eye.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;Time Out of Time&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &amp;quot;McQuerry&amp;rsquo;s compelling narrative races forward, immersing the reader in its lyrical mysteries.&amp;quot;&lt;BR&gt; --&lt;I&gt;Booklist&lt;/I&gt;, starred review&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &amp;quot;McQuerry smoothly blends adventure, coming-of-age, and mystery with a mythological world where special academic and problem-solving talents&lt;BR&gt; are required assets rather than nerd-bait for bullies.
