  <title>The Inside Story (The Sisters Grimm #8) - Michael Buckley, Peter Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Fans of fractured fairy tales will be delighted to discover the fantasy, mystery, adventure, and humor in the beloved &lt;I&gt;New York Times &lt;/I&gt;bestselling Sisters Grimm series by Michael Buckley, now with new cover art. As featured on NBC&#39;s &lt;I&gt;The Today Show, &lt;/I&gt;the nine wildly popular books are favorites around the world. They were among the first books to bring a distinctly girl-power spin to fairy tales--a spin taken up by TV shows such as &lt;I&gt;Grimm &lt;/I&gt;and&lt;I&gt; &lt;/I&gt;&lt;I&gt;Once Upon a Time,&lt;/I&gt; the bestselling book series The Land of Stories&lt;I&gt;, &lt;/I&gt;and more. &lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; Book 8 follows Sabrina, Daphne, and Puck through the world of the Book of Everafter, where all the fairy tales are stored and enchanted characters can change their destinies. The kids pursue the Master through a series of stories, where they&#39;re willing to change what they need in order to save their baby brother. Soon, however, they are confronted by The Editor--the book&#39;s guardian--who, along with an army of tiny monsters known as Revisers, threatens the children with dire consequences if they don&#39;t stick to the stories. They move from one tale to the next, chasing the Master in an attempt to stop his plan to steal and inhabit the child&#39;s body. Along the way they&#39;ll meet Alice (of Wonderland), Mowgli, Jack the Giant Killer, Hansel and Gretel, and the Headless Horseman. But will they find their brother in time?&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
