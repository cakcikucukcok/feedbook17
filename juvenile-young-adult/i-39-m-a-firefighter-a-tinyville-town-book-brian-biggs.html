  <title>I&amp;#39;m a Firefighter (A Tinyville Town Book) - Brian Biggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Tinyville Town series, new from &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author and illustrator Brian Biggs, launches with three books: &lt;I&gt;Tinyville Town Gets to Work!&lt;/I&gt;, a world-establishing picture book that introduces the town and its many residents, and two board books, &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Veterinarian&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Firefighter&lt;/I&gt;. The series is set in a cozy community where the people are kind, everyone says hello when they&amp;rsquo;re walking down the street, the bus is always on time, and all the townsfolk do their part to keep things running smoothly. Everyone has a job to do in Tinyville Town. With a nod to the busy world of Richard Scarry and the neighborhood feel of &lt;I&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/I&gt;, this new series will become a favorite read for preschoolers and is ideal for story time and class discussions about occupations and community helpers. Tinyville Town is a growing, thriving city full of interesting people. They can&amp;rsquo;t wait to show readers around!&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; In &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Firefighter&lt;/I&gt;, we see what it&amp;rsquo;s like in a day in the life of a town firefighter. As soon as the fire alarm rings, Fireman Charlie is ready to go, go, go! When he&amp;rsquo;s not fighting fires, there&amp;rsquo;s plenty to do, like cook meals for the crew, Charlie&amp;rsquo;s favorite job of all. Firefighters are perennially popular with young readers. This is an ideal read for fire prevention lessons and as a tribute to local hero firefighters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
