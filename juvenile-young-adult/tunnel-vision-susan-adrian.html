  <title>Tunnel Vision - Susan Adrian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Romance and action come crashing together in Susan Adrian&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Tunnel Vision&lt;/i&gt; in which a teenage boy with incredible powers is brought to the attention of the government.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Jake Lukin just turned 18. He&#39;s decent at tennis and &lt;i&gt;Halo&lt;/i&gt;, and waiting to hear on his app to Stanford. But he&#39;s also being followed by a creep with a gun, and there&#39;s a DARPA agent waiting in his bedroom. His secret is blown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jake holds a personal object, like a pet rock or a ring, he has the ability to &quot;tunnel&quot; into the owner. He can sense where they are, like a human GPS, and can see, hear, and feel what they do. It&#39;s an ability the government would do anything to possess: a perfect surveillance unit who could locate fugitives, spies, or terrorists with a single touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake promised his dad he&#39;d never tell anyone about his ability. But his dad died two years ago, and Jake slipped. If he doesn&#39;t agree to help the government, his mother and sister may be in danger. Suddenly he&#39;s juggling high school, tennis tryouts, flirting with Rachel Watkins, and work as a government asset, complete with 24-hour bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forced to lie to his friends and family, and then to choose whether to give up everything for their safety, Jake hopes the good he&#39;s doing--finding kidnap victims and hostages, and tracking down terrorists--is worth it. But he starts to suspect the good guys may not be so good after all. With Rachel&#39;s help, Jake has to try to escape both good guys and bad guys and find a way to live his own life instead of tunneling through others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
