  <title>Gigi and the Little Ones - Jerri R. Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&#39;Gigi and the Little Ones&#39; is a fantasy series about a young Irish girl who can see fairies. The story begins with Gigi thinking her Grandfathers stories are make believe and ends with Gigi having the knowledge that fairies are real. The story goes through all the adventures, fun and danger that Gigi and her friends experience, while Gigi learns about the magical and powerful creatures she thought were make believe. The first book in the series, &#39;The Early Year&#39;s&#39;, sets the stage. This book explains why Gigi sees the creatures when no one else acknowledges them, even when they are right in front of their face. The first book is also where Gigi begins to develop and become a strong independent person because of the obstacles she overcomes from both people around her and the different fairies she encounters. The end of the first book shows how Gigi has begun to change and is where the true adventures to come begin. This all leads into the second book in the series &#39;The Rite of Passage&#39; which will print soon.&lt;br&gt;" />
