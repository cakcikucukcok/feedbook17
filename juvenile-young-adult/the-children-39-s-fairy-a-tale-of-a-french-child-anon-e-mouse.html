  <title>THE CHILDREN&#39;S FAIRY - A Tale of a French Child - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 356&lt;br /&gt;
In this 356th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the French Child&amp;#39;s Tale &amp;quot;THE CHILDREN&amp;#39;S FAIRY&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago and far, far away, one dull, heavy afternoon, the long, dusty road looked quite deserted, not a horse or even a foot-passenger in sight. The birds were taking their afternoon siesta, and the leaves were hanging down languidly from the poor trees, which were dying with thirst. There were three solitary-looking, tumble-down cottages on one side of the road, and presently the door of one of them opened, and a woman&amp;#39;s voice called out:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Come, Yvette, come, go out and play.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
In answer to this summons a little girl of some three or four years old soon appeared, and with great difficulty on all fours began to descend the steep steps from the house to the footpath. It was quite a piece of work, that perilous descent, and it was accomplished slowly, carefully, and very awkwardly by what looked like nothing but a bundle of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;
When once she had reached the bottom of the steps, the child stood upright and looked round for a minute or two, evidently deep in thought, with her little finger pressed against her face. Play! Yes, it was all very well, but what should she play at?&lt;br /&gt;
But, Yvette&amp;mdash;on that deserted road, what could she do? Her father, a poor road-mender, earned only just enough to make a bare living for his wife and child, and certainly not a halfpenny could be spared for toys.&lt;br /&gt;
Yvette sat down just near a great heap of stones, which her father had to break into small pieces in order to fill in the ruts. When she was comfortably installed, she began to fumble in her pocket, and there she certainly found all kinds of wonderful things.&lt;br /&gt;
But what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? I mean, a child playing on a pile of stones next to a road. That can&amp;rsquo;t be safe! To find out what happened to poor little Yvette, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
