  <title>Voyage of the Snake Lady - Theresa Tomlinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have seen them!&quot; cried Cassandra. &quot;Iphigenia! Myrina and her young daughter! They are in terrible trouble . . . taken prisoner on a boat . . . stripped of all weapons!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the fall of Troy, Myrina has built the Moon Riders into a strong and potent band of warrior women. But the son of Achilles is bent on revenge, and the Moon Riders are displaced from their home and fighting for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plagued with slavery, storms, shipwreck, and strife, the Moon Riders must accept help from outsiders for their very survival. Only trust in the strong bonds of their friendship will help Myrina, Iphigenia, and Cassandra vanquish their enemies and welcome those who may help them achieve a more peaceful way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like its predecessor, this sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Moon Riders&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful blend of intriguing myth and inspired imagination, leavened by romance and unforgettable characters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
