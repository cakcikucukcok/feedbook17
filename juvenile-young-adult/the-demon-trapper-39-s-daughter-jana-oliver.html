  <title>The Demon Trapper&#39;s Daughter - Jana Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Demon Trapper&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is the first novel in Jana Oliver&#39;s Demon Trappers--a spellbinding young adult fantasy series. Riley Blackthorne just needs a chance to prove herself--and that&#39;s exactly what the demons are counting on...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Riley, the only daughter of legendary Demon Trapper Paul Blackthorne, has always dreamed of following in her father&#39;s footsteps. The good news is, with human society seriously disrupted by economic upheaval and Lucifer increasing the number of demons in all major cities, Atlanta&#39;s local Trappers&#39; Guild needs all the help they can get--even from a girl. When she&#39;s not keeping up with her homework or trying to manage her growing crush on fellow apprentice, Simon, Riley&#39;s out saving distressed citizens from foul-mouthed little devils--Grade One Hellspawn only, of course, per the strict rules of the Guild. Life&#39;s about as normal as can be for the average demon-trapping teen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then a Grade Five Geo-Fiend crashes Riley&#39;s routine assignment at a library, jeopardizing her life and her chosen livelihood.  And, as if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, sudden tragedy strikes the Trappers&#39; Guild, spinning Riley down a more dangerous path than she ever could have imagined. As her whole world crashes down around her, who can Riley trust with her heart--and her life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
