  <title>Lydia the Lazy Ladybug - Darcy Wheeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lydia the Lazy Ladybug is a creative and extraordinary creature.  This is a story about Lydia and how being different, can lead to new adventures.  Ladybugs are busy!  They have a lot of things to do, like eat other bugs, and lay lots of eggs, in a very short lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lydia is a dreamer, and she would rather watch the clouds go by and listen to sounds in the world around her instead of doing what other ladybugs expect her to do.  Lydia spends most of her time alone in an imaginary world.
Lydia wanders too far away one day and something happens.  Suddenly, she finds herself in the perfect environment with other ladybugs just like her.  Lydia learns that there is a time to get your work done and a time to daydream.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful color photographs and fun filled facts about ladybugs remind us that they are an important part of our ecosystem and an excellent natural predator for aphids in your garden.  Ladybugs like Lydia can often be purchased at a local nursery for release at home during the spring and summer months. &lt;/p&gt;" />
