  <title>Read Me a Story, Stella - Marie-Louise Gay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the first new Stella book in four years &amp;#8212; in a series that has sold two million copies in ten languages &amp;#8212; Stella introduces little brother Sam to the pleasures of reading. Sam is as busy and worried as ever, and Stella almost always has her nose in a book these days, but she finds time to help him out, while sharing her new pastime with contagious enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam has gathered a wagonload of branches to build a doghouse for Fred, and he wonders if the book Stella is reading tells you how to make one. It doesn&#39;t (although it is very funny), but Stella is more than willing to give Sam a hand. As soon as the doghouse is built though, Sam worries that a wolf might come along and blow it down. Stella breezily banishes his fears, suggesting a picnic at Lily Pond. Stella cools her feet in the water, reading a story, while Sam tries to catch a frog. Are there frogs in Stella&#39;s book, he wonders. No, Stella tells him, but there is a toad wearing a velvet jacket&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With her characteristically light touch, Marie-Louise Gay imparts the pleasures and importance of reading to her young audience, whether it be humor, fiction, nonfiction or poetry.  Her detailed, beautifully rendered and often-amusing watercolor illustrations (spot the tiny bunny reading a book!) show yet again that Marie-Louise Gay is one of the very best artists creating picture books today.  &lt;/p&gt;" />
