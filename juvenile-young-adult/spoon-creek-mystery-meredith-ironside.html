  <title>Spoon Creek Mystery - Meredith Ironside</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twelve-year-old Abigail Smiley is grounded for two weeksall because she sold her aunts old book for thirty dollars and the key to an old mansion in the forest.&lt;p&gt; 
When Drew Miller, her one and only crush, offers a rusty old key to the Nightingale house in exchange for her aunts book, Abigail is immediately suspicious. Everyone in the small town of Spoon Creek already knows the story. Two days before she died, Miss Nightingale removed nine rare antique silver dollars from her bank deposit box. No one has seen them since. When Drew tells Abigail about the five thousand dollar finders fee, Abigail is suddenly fascinated. A big cash reward could save her aunt from bankruptcy. Officially ungrounded on Halloween night, Abby is faced with a dilemma. Should she sneak out and use the key to try to earn the reward money or should she obey her aunts orders to stay home?&lt;p&gt; 
What Abby doesn&#39;t know is that the key she keeps in a dish on her dresser may not only lead her to a potential reward, but also to more trouble than she ever could have imagined." />
