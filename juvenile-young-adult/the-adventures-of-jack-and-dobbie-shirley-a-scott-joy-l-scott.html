  <title>The Adventures of Jack and Dobbie - Shirley A. Scott, Joy L. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the third book in a series about two Chihuahuas, Jack and Dobbie. The first book The Beginning describes how Dobbie came to be adopted through an animal rescue group as a playmate for Jack. The second book Happy Tails details events that nearly ended in disaster as well as more light-hearted moments of interaction with Jack. The third book Doggie Holidays describes how the dogs celebrate their birthdays and holidays. This book also details Jacks seizures and contains references to two very important people in the Scotts lives who both passed away in 2009. As their story continues in book four Traveling Buddies, children will learn about the vehicles the dogs like to ride in and the places they go. We hope you enjoy reading their story and that you may be encouraged to adopt a pet and know the true joy it brings to the home." />
