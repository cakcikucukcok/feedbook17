  <title>Mr. B and His Horses - Doreen B.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have tried to express how frightening it is for the horse to make adjustments to their new surroundings and the anxiety they go through during the move. Each animalhorse, dog, cat, etc.has a completely different personality. Some are timid, and others are bold or very brave, but one thing they have in common is their longing for a permanent home. They look forward to having an owner that will love them and give them the care they need. I hope my book will help to educate some of the future animal owners. Please give your pet a good, safe home, regular meals, and all the love and attention that they look so forward to. When you do, you will find the rewards are endless; you will find yourself with a new best friend for life." />
