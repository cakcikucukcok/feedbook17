  <title>Ouchiewahwah and Other Useful Words - Robin Seward, Avery Leill-Kok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every parent has faced that moment when their child gets frustrated and blurts out, D*@n it!, or some other unacceptable obscenity, and you know that you have no one to blame but yourself. No matter how hard we try to set a good example for our children, life happensor should I say S@%* happens. 
There are hundreds of children&#39;s books that teach good manners, and the like, but surprisingly, I was unable to find one children&#39;s book that dealt with the issue of cursing. At least, not any that offered a creative and inventive approach to those moments when you or your kids just want to scream. 
In Ouchie-Wah-Wah and Other Useful Words, you&#39;ll find phrases and words for when you are just plain bored, mad mad mad, sad or glad. These words will inspire your kids and make them laugh, all the while maintaining your sanity. I encourage you to weave these words into your everyday as well as having fun creating your own vocabulary together." />
