  <title>Samantha Sanderson Without a Trace - Robin Caroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sam Sanderson is an independent, resourceful, high-tech cheerleader. She dreams of becoming an award-winning journalist like her mother, so she&amp;rsquo;s always looking for articles to publish in her middle-school paper (where she secretly hopes to become chief editor). With a police officer for a father, Sam is in no short supply of writing material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fourth book of the Faithgirlz Samantha Sanderson series, Sam&amp;rsquo;s friend Tam Lee is missing. As the days pass, all clues seem to point to something sinister in Sam&amp;rsquo;s opinion. Sam must decide whether to do what everyone wants her to and let law enforcement continue to work as though Tam is a run-away. Or should Sam follow her heart and keep poking around looking for more clues?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Samantha Sanderson series is about an ordinary girl with extraordinary dreams. Each book touches on a crime straight from headlines, from bomb threats to bullying, while following Samantha and her friends as they navigate middle-school and questions of faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
