  <title>Connie the Three-Legged Turtle - Nancy Northrop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Connie is a happy, friendly turtle. But there is something different about Connie. While other turtles, even Connies brothers and sisters, have four legs, Connie only has three legs. She hatched from her egg that way and has lived with only three legs all of her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connie notices from the beginning that she has difficulty keeping up with the other turtles. They are uncomfortable with her handicap, so they just leave her behind. One day, Seamoor, a snail traveling across the marsh, finds Connie crying and asks her to promise to try to do her best each day. She promisesand that decision changes her life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fun and heartwarming tale, a young turtle braves her disability and becomes a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Connie the Three-Legged Turtle&lt;/i&gt; lovingly teaches the importance of accepting and supporting others and looking beyond the handicaps.&lt;br&gt;
