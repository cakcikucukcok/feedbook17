  <title>The Halls of Montezuma - Michael Cantwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fourteen-year-old Peter Collins cannot help but wonder if it was all just a dream. Even though it has been two years since he traveled back in time to ancient Mexico with his friend, Rosa Guzman, two questions continue to haunt him: Why hasn&#39;t Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent who guided Rosa and him through their time travels, returned as he had promised? Who is his real father? Peter knows the secret will be revealed once he passes his final test. When Quetzalcoatl finally shows up, the boy cannot help but feel a little anxious about his most important mission to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Peter and Rosa travel back in time once more to  the last days of the Aztec Empire, they are taken to Lord Montezuma, who declares that Topiltzin, the incarnation of Quetzalcoatl, is returning to reclaim his throne. When he hears hostile warriors are advancing toward the capital, Montezuma is convinced their leader is Topiltzin and decides to welcome him to avoid a war of all the gods. But unfortunately, Montezuma could not be more wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the exciting conclusion to the Tollan Trilogy, two teenage adventurers must create peace between the conquerors and the people of ancient Mexicobefore the future of America is changed forever and Peters past is finally revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

Now they journey to Tenochtitlan, the city of the Aztecs,&lt;strong style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;where they must set history on its right course. Tasked with no little feat, Peter and Rosa reach the heart of one of the most contentious times in Mexican history. When a conquistadorknown in Spanish as Cortescomes to the Aztec city, Peter and Rosa help Emperor Montezuma deal with the newcomer. Together they must figure out if the man is Topiltzinthe human reincarnation of Quetzalcoatlor a stranger bent on conquering the city by force. Eventually, Quetzalcoatl does in fact return, and he brings Peter and Rosa forward in history to the city of Choula, where they try to bring peace to the nascent country of Mexico by convincing the Spaniards that Mexicans deserve love, respect and equality. Cantwell superbly recreates ancient Mexico with colorful descriptions of city buildings, citizens attire and specific details like blood in the streets from human sacrifices. Despite offering an admirable message for kids, the trip to Choula feels out of place and more like a mere detour. Additionally, readers are swept away before seeing the fall of the Aztecs, which is a bit disappointing; the end of Topiltzins story is merely told to reader rather than shown. Nonetheless, Cantwell brings his trilogy to a satisfying conclusion, as Peter and Rosa realize theyre more than just friends, and Peter finally learns the shocking truth of his parentage.&lt;/p&gt;
