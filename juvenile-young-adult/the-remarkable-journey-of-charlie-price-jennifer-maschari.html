  <title>The Remarkable Journey of Charlie Price - Jennifer Maschari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A heartfelt, beautifully written novel of love, loss, and math&amp;#8212;perfect for fans of Rebecca Stead and Sharon M. Draper.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This&amp;#160;&quot;tangible allegory of grief through the eyes of a struggling 12-year-old boy&quot; has been cited by Brightly.com as a book about sadness and grief&amp;#160;that will help support kids and foster conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since twelve-year-old Charlie Price&#39;s mom died, he feels like his world has been split into two parts. &lt;em&gt;Before&lt;/em&gt; included stargazing and Mathletes and Saturday scavenger hunts with his family. &lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt; means a dad who&#39;s completely checked out, comically bad dinners, and grief group that&#39;s anything but helpful. It seems like losing Mom meant losing everything else he loved, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when Charlie thinks things can&#39;t get any worse, his sister, Imogen, starts acting erratically&amp;#8212;missing school and making up lies about their mother. But everything changes when one day he follows her down a secret passageway in the middle of her bedroom and sees for himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imogen has found a parallel world where Mom is alive! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s hot cocoa and Scrabble and scavenger hunts again and everything is perfect . . . at first. But something doesn&#39;t feel right. Whenever Charlie returns to the real world, things are different, and not in a good way. And Imogen wants to spend more and more time on the other side. It&#39;s almost as if she wants to leave the real world for good. If Charlie doesn&#39;t uncover the truth, he could lose himself, the true memory of their mother, and Imogen . . . forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
