  <title>Alan Cole Doesn&#39;t Dance - Eric Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To heartwarming cheer, Alan Cole came out to his school. &lt;em&gt;But now what?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this follow-up novel to &lt;em&gt;Alan Cole Is Not a Coward&lt;/em&gt;, Eric Bell deftly explores with nuance and humor how the first step to complete self-acceptance may mean actually putting your feet on the dance floor. This laugh-out-loud and poignant tale is perfect for fans of Gary Schmidt and Jerry Spinelli.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cole has a problem: Ron McCaughlin. Ever since Alan revealed he&amp;#8217;s gay, Ron has been bullying Alan with relentless fury. Alan can&amp;#8217;t tell his parents why he&amp;#8217;s really coming home with bruises&amp;#8212;because they still don&amp;#8217;t know the truth about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet buoyed by the support of his classmates and with his friends Zack and Madison by his side, Alan thinks he can withstand the bullying and&amp;#8212;just maybe&amp;#8212;break through to Ron. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all things come to a head when Alan&amp;#8217;s father asks that he take June Harrison to the upcoming Winter Dance. Never mind that Alan has two left feet, does not like girls, and might be developing feelings for a new boy at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resounding tale about friendship, family, and the many meanings of bravery will leave readers rooting for Alan and his gang of proud misfits once more. &lt;/p&gt;" />
