  <title>Heart of Iron - Ashley Poston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*A 2019 Rainbow Book List Selection*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An action-packed tale full of romance, royalty, and adventure, inspired by the story of &lt;em&gt;Anastasia&lt;/em&gt;. Perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Six of Crows,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cinder&lt;/em&gt;, and the cult classic television show &lt;em&gt;Firefly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ana is a scoundrel by nurture and an outlaw by nature. Found as a child drifting through space with a sentient android called D09, Ana was saved by a fearsome space captain and the grizzled crew she now calls family. But D09&amp;#8212;one of the last remaining illegal Metals&amp;#8212;has been glitching, and Ana will stop at nothing to find a way to fix him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ana&amp;#8217;s desperate effort to save D09 leads her on a quest to steal the coordinates to a lost ship that could offer all the answers. But at the last moment, a spoiled Ironblood boy beats Ana to her prize. He has his own reasons for taking the coordinates, and he doesn&amp;#8217;t care what he&amp;#8217;ll sacrifice to keep them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When everything goes wrong, she and the Ironblood end up as fugitives on the run. Now their entire kingdom is after them&amp;#8212;and the coordinates&amp;#8212;and not everyone wants them captured alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they find in a lost corner of the universe will change all their lives&amp;#8212;and unearth dangerous secrets. But when a darkness from Ana&amp;#8217;s past returns, she must face an impossible choice: does she protect a kingdom that wants her dead or save the Metal boy she loves? &lt;/p&gt;" />
