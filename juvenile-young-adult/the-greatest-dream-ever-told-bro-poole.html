  <title>The Greatest Dream Ever Told - Bro. Poole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book, The Greatest Dream Ever Told, is a fictional adventure of a grandpa and his beagle dog, as they travel back into the Bible to visit some of Gods greatest people in the midst of their trials, tribulations, temptations, and of course victories.  It contains adventures that will ignite the interest of Gods Word and cause a hunger for a personal adventure and relationship with Jesus Christ.
  As your children take this adventure into Jim and Annies dream through the Bible, they will laugh and stand amazed as they see the Bible come alive to them. As they read the book, they will also be encouraged to read the corresponding passages in the Bible.  There will also be discussion questions that will help their parents or Sunday School teachers dig deeper into the spiritual truths God has in store for them.  As with one of the main characters in the book, they will have a chance to ask Jesus to come into their heart to be their Lord and Savior.
  It is Jim and Annies prayer that God will use this simple book to do a great work in the heart of all that may read it, or have it read to them.
In Christ
