  <title>The Opposite of Innocent - Sonya Sones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poignant and chilling by turns, &lt;em&gt;The Opposite of Innocent&lt;/em&gt; is award-winning author Sonya Sones&amp;#8217;s most gripping novel in verse yet. It&amp;#8217;s the story of a girl named Lily, who&amp;#8217;s been crushing on a man named Luke, a friend of her parents, ever since she can remember.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luke has been away for two endless years, but he&amp;#8217;s finally returning today. Lily was only twelve when he left. But now, at fourteen, she feels transformed. She can&amp;#8217;t wait to see how Luke will react when he sees the new her. And when her mother tells her that Luke will be staying with them for a while, in the bedroom right next to hers, her heart nearly stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having Luke back is better than Lily could have ever dreamed. His lingering looks set Lily on fire. Is she just imagining them? But then, when they&amp;#8217;re alone, he kisses her. Then he kisses her again. Lily&amp;#8217;s friends think anyone &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; age who wants to be with a fourteen-year-old must be really messed up. Maybe even dangerous. But Luke would never do anything to hurt her...would he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this powerful tale of a terrifying leap into young adulthood, readers will accompany Lily on her harrowing journey from hopelessness to hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
