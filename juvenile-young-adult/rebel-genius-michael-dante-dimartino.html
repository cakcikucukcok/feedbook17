A few artists possess Geniuses, birdlike creatures that are the living embodiment of an artist&#39;s creative spirit. Those caught with one face a punishment akin to death, so when Giacomo discovers he has a Genius, he knows he&#39;s in serious trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, he finds safety in a secret studio where young artists and their Geniuses train in sacred geometry to channel their creative energies as weapons. But when a murderous artist goes after the three Sacred Tools--objects that would allow him to destroy the world and everyone in his path--Giacomo and his friends must risk their lives to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;DiMartino masterfully weaves a thrilling action-adventure epic into an imaginative and terrifying world.&quot; --Bryan Konietzko, co-creator of &lt;i&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Legend of Korra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Rebel Genius&lt;/i&gt; is a natural extension of Michael Dante DiMartino&#39;s work on&lt;i&gt; Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/i&gt;: charming young heroes, magical creatures, an innovative magic system, and mysteries galore.
