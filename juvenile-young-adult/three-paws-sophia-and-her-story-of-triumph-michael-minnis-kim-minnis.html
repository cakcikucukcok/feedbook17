  <title>Three Paws: Sophia and Her Story of Triumph - Michael Minnis, Kim Minnis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life was everything a cat like Sophia could possibly want. She had toys, plenty of food, a warm bed, lots of friends, and a family who loved her. What could go wrong? You’ll learn in Three Paws: Sophia and Her Story of Triumph that things can change very quickly. When a serious medical condition results in the amputation of one of her legs, she is forced to meet new challenges with just three legs. Sophia’s kitten nieces visit and help her find more self-confidence. But when two bully cats move into the neighborhood, they challenge her and threaten her nieces. Through this and her other experiences as a three-legged cat, Sophia learns an important lesson: it’s what’s in your heart that counts. Three Paws: Sophia and Her Story of Triumph shows that even if you’re different, you are worthy—whether a cat or a human." />
