  <title>Jay and Katie Go Hawaii - Kathryn Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What started out as a family vacation for ten-year-old Jay and his nine-year-old friend Katie turned into an adventure of a lifetime. While enjoying the many sights of Hawaii, they were enmeshed in a mystery that included a ring of thieves, stolen items from their own hometown of Memphis, and more. 
As the two sleuths followed the clues, they found themselves learning and exploring the Hawaiian culture day-by-day, as well as learning more about the Tiptoe Burglars. 
If you are planning a trip to Hawaii with children, youll find some great excursion ideas. If youre visiting and want to take a fun adventure book home for your children or grandchildren, ages seven through ten, get a hard copy or order an e-book for them." />
