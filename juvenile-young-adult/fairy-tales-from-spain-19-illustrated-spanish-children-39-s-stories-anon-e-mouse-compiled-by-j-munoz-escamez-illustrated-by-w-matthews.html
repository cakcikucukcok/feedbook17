  <title>FAIRY TALES from SPAIN - 19 Illustrated Spanish Children&#39;s Stories - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by J. Munoz Escamez, Illustrated by W. Matthews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this volume you will find 19 fairy tales and folklore from Spain plus a few from other countries brought back to Spain by sailors and travellers in the heyday of their great navy. Compiled by J. Munoz Escamez, these 19 Spanish tales are further enhanced by the eight colour plates by W. Matthews.&lt;br /&gt;
Here you will find uniquely Spanish tales like: The City of Fortune, The Garden of Health, Carabi! Carabo!, The Author of the Wall, The Devil&amp;#39;s Tournament, The Treasure of the Dragon, The Man with the Two Faces plus many more.&lt;br /&gt;
Many of the old fairy tale books published over a century ago, best sellers in their time, are now in a dilapidated condition. Reading them would only ruin them further. But there is a solution! It is the aim of Abela Publishing to give these old books new life in the digital age and ensure they are kept alive for our children and our children&amp;rsquo;s children. Abela is the Zulu word for to share or distribute. As such Abela Publishing will donate 10% of the profit from the sale of this book to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
We invite you to curl up with this unique sliver of Spanish culture not seen in print for over a century; and immerse yourself in the tales and fables of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;
