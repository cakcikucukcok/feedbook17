  <title>Into? - North Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;You must read this now!&quot; - &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Into? &lt;/i&gt;North Morgan shines a coolly mesmerizing light on the modern generation of gay men that are living firmly outside the closet, elevated by popular culture, but plagued by a new set of problems, insecurities and self-destructions. As the men of &lt;i&gt;Into?&lt;/i&gt;  swipe right from bed to bed, North Morgan spins a darkly hilarious, and shockingly perceptive story of excess and love that&#39;s like nothing you&#39;ve ever read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know Konrad  from your various social feeds - sun kissed, gym ripped and always having a better time than you. Or is he?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Konrad Platt needed to get out of town. Heartbroken after his boyfriend left him for another man, Konrad abandoned his life in London for the warm sun and blue surf of LA. Here he attends parties in the Hollywood Hills filled with handsome men and beautiful women, snorts mountains of Adderall, and dances the weekends away at Coachella with each move endlessly documented on social media. He mends his broken heart through dating apps, constantly scrolling through profiles and chatting with a seemingly endless supply of men, each one handsomer than the last. But when one captures his heart, a twisted modern romance takes root that&#39;s thrilling, confusing, and devastating - revealing that underneath this perfectly curated profile is a man desperate for real connection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
