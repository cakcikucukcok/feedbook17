  <title>Groomilda, the Witch - Ellie Karmaniolos, Sierra Mon Ann Vidal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One evening, Grandma told her young boys John, Chris, and George the story of a silly witch who loved to fly. Groomilda was an old witch who spent her nights riding a broom through the park and beyond. She tended to be clumsy, but she looked the part of a witch with her red and yellow striped socks and her pointed hat.
Groomilda even had a companiona cat named Mr. Mitch, who hung on tightly to the top of her broomstick as she flew around town. Mr. Mitch enjoyed their nighttime flights almost as much as Groomilda as she adventured across rooftops and high into the night sky, greeting the glittering stars and maybe even the moon.
The boys find a broom in their own room and decide they want to fly like Groomilda, too. However, the boys arent witches. They dont have magicexcept for the magic of imagination. Where will their imaginations take them, or will silly chores get in the way of flying high through the sky with a witch by their side?" />
