      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I haven&#39;t even explained yet about the Knitting Lady. Who is she? How did I wind up on her doorstep? How did I meet the other girls who became my friends--no, they became more than friends--despite the fact that they drove me absolutely crazy. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I need to take a giant step back, return myself to the police car and explain how I, Cal Lavender, came to be living a life that wasn&#39;t my own.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A witty and moving first novel that uncovers another side of the foster-care system&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cal Lavender is perfectly happy living her anonymous life, even if she does have to play mother to her own mother a whole lot more than an eleven-year-old should. But when Cal&#39;s mother has one of her &quot;unfortunate episodes&quot; in the middle of the public library, she is whisked off by the authorities and Cal is escorted to a seat in the back of a police car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &quot;just a short, temporary detour from what I call life,&quot; Cal finds herself in a group home with four other girls, watched over by a strange old woman everyone refers to as the Knitting Lady. At first Cal can think of nothing but how to get out of this nuthouse. She knows she doesn&#39;t belong there. But it turns out that all the girls, and even the Knitting Lady, may have a lot more in common than they could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;A fresh new voice in middle-grade fiction--Jill Wolfson&#39;s unforgettable characters will blunder their way into readers&#39; hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
