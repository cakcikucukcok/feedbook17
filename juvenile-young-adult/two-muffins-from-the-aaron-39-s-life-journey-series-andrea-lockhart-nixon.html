  <title>Two Muffins: From the &quot;Aaron&#39;s Life Journey&quot; Series - Andrea Lockhart-Nixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Illustrated by Destiny Newby. Two Muffins is about a 5-year-old little boy named Aaron and a five-year-old little girl named Peggy, who is nick named, &quot;Cutie Pie Peggy,&quot; in the book. Peggy is a chubby little girl who loves to eat and is often teased about her weight. Aaron, in the story, is the coolest boy in his class. However, Aaron needs to be taught a lesson about acceptance and how God wants us to view others. When the class see how Aaron make fun of Peggy, they begin to do the same. Will Aaron learn a lesson? Will Peggy be teased all year? The answer to these questions is in the must purchase book, Two Muffins. I promise you will not be disappointed. This book can be used as a teaching tool for teachers, parents, and others when dealing with sensitive topics such as obesity, exclusion, bullying, and prejudice with children. It is my hope, throughout my series of books, I will reach children who may share some of Aaron&#39;s experiences and gain positive views and hope for a more accepting world." />
