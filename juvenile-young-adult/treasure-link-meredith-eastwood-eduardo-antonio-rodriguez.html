    Adventures of a Hemingway Cat

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Meredith Eastwood
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There is no turning back for Buffett, a seven-toed cat, after he escapes from a popular Key West cat show. Frustrated by the vicious teasing of other cats
    for his deformed paws and inability to perform tricks, he decides to search for the Hemingway House, a place where polydactyl cats can live in peace. When
    Gil, a mysterious pirate cat, gives him a gold treasure link, Buffett is drawn into encounters with several out-of-the-ordinary animals. He learns about a
    community rich in history, yet also challenged by environmental issues that endanger the lives of some of the animals who befriend him. But all is not as
    it seems. He discovers the existence of the Alliance, a secret group of cats who also wear gold treasure links. As evil villains and challenges test his
    courage, Buffett discovers the secrets of his past and a destiny he could not have imagined.
