  <title>Young Captain Nemo - Jason Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Armed with his wits, his friends, and his Nemotech submarine, a twelve-year-old descendant of Jules Verne&#39;s famous antihero is determined to help make the ocean a safer place one adventure at a time in Jason Henderson&#39;s &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Young Captain Nemo, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;first in a new middle-grade series.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Gabriel Nemo is  not your typical 12-year-old. A descendant of the famous Captain Nemo, he  spent the first years of his life living in obscurity, isolated in his  parents&#39; peaceful underwater research lab. But with his older sister off  following in their ancestor&#39;s footsteps, sinking whalers and running away from  vengeful navies, Gabriel decides it&#39;s time to forge his own path, and use his  Nemotech legacy for good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed only with  his wits, his friends, and his Nemotech submarine, Gabriel embarks on a series  of daring rescues and exciting undersea battles. But when Gabriel&#39;s sister  suddenly appears with proof of previously undiscovered sea creatures--giant  beasts inhabiting wrecked war planes and ships--Gabriel and his new friends  must face their biggest and most dangerous mission ever!&lt;/p&gt;" />
