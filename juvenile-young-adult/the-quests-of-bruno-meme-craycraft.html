  <title>The Quests of Bruno - MeMe Craycraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When our family unanimously agreed that we wanted another dog we began looking for the Perfect Pet.  We had two sons that were all boys; so we wanted a boys dog, one that would romp and play and be their companion.
We researched book after book about different dogs.  Finally, we agreed on the breed and found a breeder in a nearby town.  Mr. King explained that he had a litter of puppies that were three weeks old and that they wouldnt be ready for another three weeks. 
 When we went to the kennel, Mr. King opened the gate and five little puppies came frolicking out, four went to Mr. King and one came running and stumbling towards us.  He lunged towards Cole and Drew knocking them down giving them puppy dog kisses.  It was a magical moment and the hunt was over.  HE CHOSE US.  He was a beautiful, fawn colored Boxer.  He had four white tipped paws and a white star on his chest. We didnt even look at the other four little puppies.
That was the beginning of all the new adventures of this little puppy and his new family." />
