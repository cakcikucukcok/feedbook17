  <title>Kitty and the Moonlight Rescue - Paula Harrison, Jenny Lovlie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl by day. Cat by night. Ready for an adventure.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitty and the Moonlight Rescue&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is the first book in a chapter book series about Kitty and her superhero adventures.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This chapter book is an excellent choice to share during homeschooling, in particular for children ages 6 to 8 who are ready to read independently. It&amp;#8217;s a fun way to keep your child engaged and as a supplement for activity books for children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Kitty, a charming chapter book character with catlike superpowers. With dramatic two-color art on every page and an emphasis on friendship, family, bravery, and building self-confidence, &lt;em&gt;Kitty and the Moonlight Rescue&lt;/em&gt; is a perfect choice for independent readers and fans of Rebecca Elliott&amp;#8217;s Owl Diaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitty is special. Her mother is a superhero with catlike powers that Kitty and her little brother Max will someday inherit. But being a superhero involves going on daring adventures at night, and Kitty doesn&amp;#8217;t know if she&amp;#8217;ll ever be brave enough for that! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night though, Kitty finds a sleek black cat with white paws waiting at her window. When he introduces himself, Kitty is shocked to realize she can understand him&amp;#8212;her powers have arrived! The cat, Figaro, has a problem. There&amp;#8217;s a terrible meowing sound coming from the clock tower, and the other cats don&amp;#8217;t know what to do. The night outside looks cold and uninviting, and Kitty is afraid of the dark. But she musters up her courage and sets out to find the source of the mysterious sound. Along the way, she makes new friends, uncovers her confidence, and learns what it means to be brave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;With an aspirational main character, a kindle of cats, striking two-color art on every page, and fun facts included at the end of each story, these chapter books are just right for newly independent readers&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
