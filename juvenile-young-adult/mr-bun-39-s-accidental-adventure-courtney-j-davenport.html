Due to his round and lightweight nature, he accidentally blows out the window and ends up taking an adventure for a year. He makes friends and experiences all four seasons for the first time, and how beautiful each one can be. It also makes him realize how wonderful home is. 
So come roll around with Mr. Bun on his accidental adventure, bob along with him on the seawaves, and fly through the sky with him in a seagulls wing. Hell be glad you came along!" />
