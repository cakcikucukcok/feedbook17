&lt;p&gt;Fay was adopted when he was a baby. He knows only that his birth mother escaped the war in Bosnia and that he arrived in his new home with nothing more than a squeaky toy and a few clothes. His older sister Bing was adopted too, from China, where she was found abandoned on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Fay&#39;s friend Maud discovers he is adopted, she urges him to search for his birth mother, but this creates mayhem at home, since there is no possibility of Bing ever being able to find her birth mother. Gradually Fay&#39;s complicated feelings about searching for his mother and his ambivalent feelings for Maud unfold. Hof&#39;s insight into human nature results in a truthful, sometimes funny, sometimes painful rendering of family life and the challenges of being adopted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
