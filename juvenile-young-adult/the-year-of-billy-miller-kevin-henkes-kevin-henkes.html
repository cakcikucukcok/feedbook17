  <title>The Year of Billy Miller - Kevin Henkes, Kevin Henkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A 2014 Newbery Honor Book&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning, nationally bestselling author Kevin Henkes introduces second-grader Billy Miller in this fast-paced and funny story about friendship, sibling rivalry, and elementary school. &lt;em&gt;The Year of Billy Miller&lt;/em&gt; includes black-and-white art by Kevin Henkes and is perfect for fans of the Ramona books; Frindle, by Andrew Clements; and the Clementine series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; declared: &amp;#34;Henkes&amp;#39;s delightful story is restrained and vivid . . . forgoing the overdramatic or zany, it shows the substance, warmth and adaptability of beautifully common family love.&amp;#34; When Billy Miller has a mishap at the statue of the Jolly Green Giant at the end of summer vacation, he ends up with a big lump on his head. What a way to start second grade, with a lump on your head! As the year goes by, though, Billy figures out how to navigate elementary school, how to appreciate his little sister, and how to be a more grown up and responsible member of the family and a help to his busy working mom and stay-at-home dad. Newbery Honor author and Caldecott Medalist Kevin Henkes delivers a short, satisfying, laugh-out-loud-funny school and family story that features a diorama homework assignment, a school poetry slam, cancelled sleepovers, and epic sibling temper tantrums. This is a perfect short novel for the early elementary grades.&lt;/p&gt;" />
