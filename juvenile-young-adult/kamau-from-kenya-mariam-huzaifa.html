  <title>Kamau from Kenya - Mariam Huzaifa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Join Kamau as he explores some of the wondrous places in his country and shows you a glimpse of his life in Nairobi. He is a young boy with a taste of adventure and excitement. He takes you to two renowned National parks and describes some of the things that make up the Kenyan culture, region and tradition.&lt;br&gt; 
Have fun reading and imagining all that he sees in this book which is made up of two parts.&lt;p&gt; 
Part 1: Kamau and the field trip&lt;br&gt; &quot;Chirp, chirp,&quot; went the birds. Kamau opened his eyes and the first thought that came to his mind was, today was the day! He got up with excitement, raced to the bathroom, put on all his clothes and went to the kitchen for breakfast where mama was making fried eggs.&lt;p&gt; 
Part 2: Kamau and The Flamingoes&lt;br&gt; 
&quot;Toot, toot.&quot;&lt;br&gt;He was here! Uncle James was here! Kamau raced out of the house with his small bagpack full of his favorite toys and a small blanket incase it got cold on his trip.&lt;/p&gt;" />
