  <title>Falcon Quinn and the Black Mirror - Jennifer Finney Boylan, Brandon Dorman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thirteen-year-old Falcon Quinn and his neighbors, Max and Megan, board bus number 13 for school on an ordinary day in Cold River, Maine. Only the bus doesn&#39;t take its ordinary route, and Falcon and his friends soon find themselves in an extraordinary place&amp;#8212;on Shadow Island, at the Academy for Monsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a student body stranger than the cast of any monster movie Falcon has ever seen, the academy is home to creatures and oddities of all kinds. In the academy&#39;s atmosphere, Falcon&#39;s friends begin to unleash and enjoy their monster natures, from flying with Pearl, &lt;em&gt;La Chupakabra&lt;/em&gt;, to decaying with the &quot;Zombie Snap.&quot; Falcon has always felt different, with his one bright blue eye and one shadow-black eye, but is he really a &lt;em&gt;monster&lt;/em&gt;? Will he discover the other thing that makes him different when he finds himself in the Black Mirror? And when he learns that the school&#39;s mission is to teach students to hide their aberrant natures, Falcon and his friends need to find a way to fight back for their monster selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author Jennifer Finney Boylan introduces Falcon, Max, Megan, and their band of monster friends in this first installment of a hair-raising and sidesplitting adventure of monstrous proportions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
