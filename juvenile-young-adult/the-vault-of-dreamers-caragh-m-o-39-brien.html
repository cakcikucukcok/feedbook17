  <title>The Vault of Dreamers - Caragh M. O&#39;Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Forge School is the most prestigious arts school in the country. The secret to its success: every moment of the students&#39; lives is televised as part of the insanely popular Forge Show, and the students&#39; schedule includes twelve hours of induced sleep meant to enhance creativity. But when first year student Rosie Sinclair skips her sleeping pill, she discovers there is something off about Forge. In fact, she suspects that there are sinister things going on deep below the reaches of the cameras in the school. What&#39;s worse is, she starts to notice that the ridges of her consciousness do not feel quite right. And soon, she unearths the ghastly secret that the Forge School is hiding--and what it truly means to dream there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Caragh M. O&#39;Brien, author of the Birthmarked trilogy comes the first book in a new series, &lt;i&gt;The Vault of Dreamers&lt;/i&gt;, a fast-paced, psychologically thrilling novel about what happens when your dreams are not your own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
