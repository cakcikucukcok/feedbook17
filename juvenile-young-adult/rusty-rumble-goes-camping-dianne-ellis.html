  <title>Rusty Rumble Goes Camping - Dianne Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This comical picture book, suitable for children up to six years, is the third book in the Rusty Rumble series. It follows on from Rusty Rumble and his Smelly Socks and Rusty Rumbles Day at the Beach. 
As a loved member of the Rumble family, Rusty joins his family for a camping weekend. The Australian bush is full of new and wondrous smells and Rustys curiosity soon lands him in trouble. Rusty is fascinated by his new surroundings but protecting his family is his first priority in life. In doing so, Rusty experiences close encounters with a number of bush animals such as a possum, echidna, snake, platypus, and a kangaroo, to name a few. This book shares many amusing adventures; however, the weekend proves to be very stressful and tiring for this vigilant little dog.
Rusty enjoys his weekend away but feels much safer and happier at home with his loving family." />
