After her father signs an anti-development petition, she loses access to the local resort and takes to the backcountry, where she meets nature on its own terms. When adventure turns to tragedy, Charlotte learns that even our deepest scars can be lucky ones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;ANA MARIA SPAGNA &lt;/B&gt;lives and writes in Stehekin, Washington, a very small town in the North Cascades accessible only by foot, ferry, or float plane.
