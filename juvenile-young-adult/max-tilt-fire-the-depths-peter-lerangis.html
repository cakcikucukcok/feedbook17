  <title>Max Tilt: Fire the Depths - Peter Lerangis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A bold, big-hearted start to a groundbreaking new series.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Soman Chainani, author of &lt;em&gt;The School for Good and Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;author of the Seven Wonders series and books in the 39 Clues series, Peter Lerangis, brings us the enthralling first installment of the adventure-filled Max Tilt trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When thirteen-year-old Max Tilt happens upon his great-great-great-grandfather Jules Verne&amp;#8217;s unfinished, unpublished manuscript, &lt;em&gt;The Lost Treasures&lt;/em&gt;, he doesn&amp;#8217;t realize that he&amp;#8217;s found the answers to all his problems. And Max has a lot of problems&amp;#8212;his mother is sick, his father is out of work, and his home is about to be foreclosed on. But when Max and his cousin Alex discover that Verne&amp;#8217;s last work reveals everything he wrote was fact, not fiction, they realize that the book holds the key to something incredibly valuable. A treasure that can save his house&amp;#8212;and maybe his entire family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Max and Alex aren&amp;#8217;t the only ones who know about Verne&amp;#8217;s clues. Spencer Niemend, a strange skunk-haired man who has spent his life researching Verne&amp;#8217;s works, is bent on reshaping the world with the hidden treasure. To find it first, Max and Alex must go on an adventure that&amp;#8217;ll take them from the broken remains of an underwater city to the very jaws of a giant squid to the edges of a whirlpool from which no one has ever emerged alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first book in a new hair-raising, edge-of-your-seat adventure series from master storyteller and &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Peter Lerangis.&lt;/p&gt;" />
