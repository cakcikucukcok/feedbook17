  <title>Wolf Storm - Dee Garretson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is Stefan&amp;#8217;s big break. He&amp;#8217;s on location in the mountains far from home for his first movie role, filming a blockbuster sci-fi adventure. The props, the spaceships, and the trained wolves on set should add up to a dream job, but acting turns out to be much tougher than he ever imagined, and he feels like his inner loser is all that&amp;#8217;s showing through. From the way his famously stuck-up co-star, Raine, treats him, he&amp;#8217;s pretty sure she thinks so too. And worst of all, no one will believe his claim that there are wild wolves haunting the forest around the set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a blizzard strikes, isolating the young co-stars and bringing hungry feral wolves into the open, Stefan must take on his biggest role yet&amp;#8212;working together with his co-stars to survive. With no second takes, they only have one chance to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lights,&lt;br /&gt;Camera,&lt;br /&gt;Action!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dee Garretson takes suspense and danger to new heights with her thrilling tale of friendship and survival against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
