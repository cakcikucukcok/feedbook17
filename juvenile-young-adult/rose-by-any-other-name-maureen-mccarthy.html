  <title>Rose by Any Other Name - Maureen McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don&#39;tcha just hate the way you get caught up in stuff without really wanting to? Then it goes a bit further, and suddenly you&#39;re one of those jerks you hate because . . . you can&#39;t be trusted. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROSE WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO GET AWAY. Last year she&#39;d had it all: pre-law in the fall, a budding romance, and her best friend, Zoe. Now Zoe will never forgive her, her family is crumbling, and the secret that&#39;s been boiling up inside her is bubbling a little too close to the surface. All Rose needs to escape are an old van, her surfboard, the road, the ocean, and . . . mom? When Rose&#39;s mother jumps in the passenger seat right as Rose is about to set off, her trip takes an unexpected turn, filled with nagging memories of last year, and the looming scandal that refuses to be ignored. A twisting plot that keeps you guessing, told from the viewpoint of a realistically flawed yet snarky main character, makes this a book that just can&#39;t be put down.&lt;/p&gt;" />
