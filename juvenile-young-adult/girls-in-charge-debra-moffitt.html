  <title>Girls in Charge - Debra Moffitt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the popular KidsHealth website, THE PINK LOCKER SOCIETY features a trio of teens who have taken on a mysterious mission--to help middle school girls by answering their questions about anything, especially the PBBs (Periods, Bras, and Boys). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a long time, Jemma, Piper, and Kate have tossed boys aside to spend time on their one true love: THE PINK LOCKER SOCIETY. And with the help of two-well placed school officials, they&#39;re back in their swanky pink offices. But how long will it last?  &lt;br&gt;Jemma is juggling school, the cross country team, becoming a big sister, and all the Pink Locker action, including a tough new problem from a bullied classmate. With 8th grade graduation around the corner, the girls have to decide who will carry on the Pink Locker Society&#39;s important mission. Are there 7th graders who have the right stuff to be in the PLS? And just as Jemma&#39;s life is bursting with excitement, Forrest reappears and seems genuinely interested in her. Even though she keeps him at arms&#39; length, she has one lingering question: Was he the one who sent her a pink carnation on Valentine&#39;s Day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From crushes, to friendship, to family surprises, GIRLS IN CHARGE explores the concerns that so many young girls talk about with their friends. Funny, entertaining, and honest, this fourth installment of the Pink Locker Society series feels like having your BFF by your side.&lt;/p&gt;" />
