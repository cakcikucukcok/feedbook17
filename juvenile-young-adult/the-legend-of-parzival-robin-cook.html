  <title>The Legend of Parzival - Robin Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enter the extraordinary world of Arthurian legend in an adventure overflowing with knightly chivalry, the danger of jousting and the warmth of true love. But the Legend of Parzival is more than the tale of one knight&#39;s epic journey to find the elusive Holy Grail; along the way Parzival faces a challenging journey of self-discovery. He must conquer his ignorance and pride, and learn humility and compassion before he is finally worthy of becoming a Grail Knight.
This accessible prose retelling of the medieval German epic brings the wonderful story of the Arthurian knight (known variously as Parzival, Parsifal and Percival) to life for today&#39;s readers, while faithfully preserving the story, characters and tone of Wolfram von Eschenbach&#39;s thirteenth century narrative poem.
In Steiner-Waldorf education, Parzival&#39;s quest is seen as a metaphor for the difficult journey through life, which speaks strongly to the adolescent, and its study is at the heart of the Class 11 curriculum. As a hugely experienced Steiner-Waldorf teacher, Robin Cook&#39;s engaging retelling will provide valuable inspiration for other teachers and students, as well as enjoyment and enrichment for all readers." />
