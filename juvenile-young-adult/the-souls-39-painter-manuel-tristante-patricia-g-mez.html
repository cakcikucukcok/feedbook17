&lt;b&gt;Excerpt from the book:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;He had lived the same situation several times with many other people and, although it seemed to be the same, he did not get used to it. The first tear of the soul was already on the canvas. It was only a matter of days...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Synopsis: &lt;/b&gt;
Since ever, Jeremiah’s vocation had been to translate the reality helping himself of the painting and the drawing. However, his parents had never supported him in this facet.
Suddenly one day his life changed, when a man nicknamed as &quot;The Mad Musician&quot; appeared in a market to make him see his talent as an artist that he had inside. With his gifts, Jeremiah presented himself to be the painter of the King&#39;s Court in a multitudinous contest.
Despite the greatness of the prize, the young painter realized that his talent was not enough for the monarch to be satisfied. This led him to invoke someone older than the world, a dark entity with whom he had never wanted to dream, putting in danger, not only his own existence, but also that of his loved ones.
His wailings would be useless, since evil was capable of using anyone in order to achieve its goal.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What will you find inside?&lt;/b&gt;
1 Address the life of two artists.
2 Pure terror, suspense and mystery.
3 Two periods of time in time jumps.
4 Demons and conspiracies.
5 A different narrative.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What readers say:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;&#39;The souls&#39; painter&#39; can be approached from different perspectives. From the simple pleasure of reading a horror story to understanding the moral behaviors of those who transgress human norms. From the psychological and individual profile, to the social and group. From love to art, hate and fatigue in the search for perfection&quot;, &lt;i&gt;Cuatro Bastardos magazine.&lt;/i&gt;
&quot;Simple language, precise descriptions and a plot that hooks and leaves you glued to the pages of the book without you knowing ver" />
