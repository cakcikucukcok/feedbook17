  <title>The Victorious King of Most High - John 14 23 Ministries Inc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Cost of this Product: Chapter 8 alone is priceless. Revelations of God and Christ revealed that 3rd and 2nd Heaven spirits, Christians that have fallen asleep and O.T. saints suffered, were killed and put in damnation fire, all from God having become jealous of ME.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After 2003, God departed the Sceptre for the Kingdom of God through The Lion of the Tribe of Judah/Christ, to The Royal Tiger over Light, ME, LORD WILBERT, The Rev. Ch. 1 God Oil Anointed and Spoken Victorious King of Most High: From Genesis 49:10 &quot;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a law giver from between his feet until Shiloh (Jesus Christ) come.&quot;, &amp; Matthew 21:43 &quot;Therefore, I say unto you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John&#39;s son, Joel Osteen: &quot;You&#39;ve honored God. You&#39;ve been faithful. You passed the test. Now, God is saying, there&#39;s about to be a flood, but not with water.&quot; It&#39;s a flood of Favor.&quot; People will come out of the wood work to help you out.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kenneth Copeland: &quot;Jesus words trump everything else.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T.D. Jakes on God&#39;s behalf: &quot;A new Dimension of Grace&quot; &quot;I want you to have Dominion. Run it! Run it!&quot; &quot;If you couldn&#39;t handle it, I would have shut the door. When I open the door, it&#39;s a sign, you can handle it!&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The World Renowned King of Preaching, Bishop Clarence E. McClendon: &quot;No, No. Not heresy. Not things that take us away from the word or from the person of Christ.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s gonna begin with what Jesus said. It&#39;s gonna be rooted in what Jesus said.&quot; &quot;Why? Because somebody saw something you didn&#39;t know you needed.&quot;" />
