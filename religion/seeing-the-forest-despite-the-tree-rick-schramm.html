  <title>Seeing the Forest Despite the Tree - Rick Schramm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a young person seeking an education, career, a loving family, a dream home, and all the good things this world has to offer. Having gone to college, married your soul mate, conceived a miraculous son, and built your dream home, you are well on your way when you are diagnosed with a brain tumor and told by a neurosurgeon that you are going to go blind and die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But God saves your life in an eight-hour brain surgery. He gives you an incredible near-death experience in a second brain surgery in which you are shown amazing knowledge that is so far above what this world knows that you are filled with the unspeakable joy of being able to understand this knowledge. Then God removes all this understanding from you except for two words and calls you to recreate this knowledge from the Bible and share it with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come with me as we recreate this knowledge by piecing together amazing truths and hidden wisdom found in the Word of God, and we will learn things we never knew that we never knew. The word &quot;mystery&quot; is found in the Bible some twenty-one times along with many parables, signs, metaphors, and symbolic language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone once described the Bible as a ten thousand-piece puzzle to be solved without the benefit of a picture on the box to guide you. We will piece together these truths, going into the ancient Hebrew and Greek definitions when necessary, to understand what the writers of the Bible understood, to create a picture of reality that goes far beyond this world we know. This understanding will challenge what we believe to be true and change what we desire in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And that is exactly what the Bible was meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
