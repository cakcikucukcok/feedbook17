  <title>Twelve Weeks in Spring - James Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; There is a fundamental Christian virtue which today has been all but abandoned by the evangelical Christian church in the Western World. It is unpopular because it does not rest comfortably with our success-driven, survival-of-the-fittest, consumer society. It is distasteful because it is perceived to require us to be less than we really are, when we wish to appear more than we really are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am referring, of course, to the virtue of humility (Matt. 5:3) which is not easy to define but in practical terms can often mean little more than giving place to others and showing them respect and courtesy, whatever the circumstances. This little book is about what can happen when humility is completely cast aside and what I believe Almighty God has to say to us on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;" />
