World Disease
Antichrist
Babylon The Harlot
Armageddon is a heavenly war, earthly war and demon war. Armageddon is the Super bowl of wars. Armageddon is about war and the Second Coming of Christ. Armageddon will be an epic, magic showdown. Armageddon is really about the battle for earth and the Return of the Gods.
                World Disease. The world disease is anger and hatred. Therefore, human nature will have stiff resistance concerning the nature of Christ. The whole world lays in the power of this wicked disease.
Antichrist. The Anti Christ was foretold by the Prophet Daniel, so was the rise of the antichrist and the mark of the Beast is also foretold in Revelation. The Antichrist and his sister The Harlot will co-create a governmental Beast that will rise to power. The deal is in the details.
Babylon/ The Harlot- The modern day mother of all Harlots is widely believed to the Pope and his gangsters who rule the alien mother church. There is religious Babylon then there is Commercial Babylon. Babylon is associated with false worship, lies, sorcery, corruption and trafficking of human souls." />
