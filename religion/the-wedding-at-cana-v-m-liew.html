  <title>The Wedding at Cana - V.M. Liew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It seems that the glory of Christ has departed from the mind and hearts of many Christians. Today the word glory, or phrases such as glory of God and glorifying God, are commonly used by Christians, and thus have evolved into clichs. They have lost their originally intended meanings. Christians are not experiencing the glory of Christ and the Kingdom of God that is here and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you experiencing the glory and the kingdom in your life? If not, this book has the answers for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like John 2: 1--11, this book is a foretaste of glory divine. It all overflows here: faith, glory, kingdom, meaning, celebration, blessing, joy, salvation, Jesus the Lord, and us who receive newness of life! The author, V. M. Liew, is an adroit semiotician, a grand interpreter of signs--especially this first sign in John 2 by which Jesus revealed his Messianic glory--and so much more. Im greatly encouraged by this book, and you will be too. Its a must read!&lt;br /&gt;
--Dr. David Naugle, distinguished professor and chair and professor of philosophy, Dallas Baptist University, and author of &lt;em&gt;Reordered Love, Reordered Lives: Learning the Deep Meaning of Happiness&lt;/em&gt; (Eerdmans, 2008)&lt;/p&gt;" />
