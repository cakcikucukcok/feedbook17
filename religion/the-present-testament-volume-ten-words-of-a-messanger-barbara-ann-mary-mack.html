  <title>The Present Testament-Volume Ten - Words of a Messanger - Barbara Ann Mary Mack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have been sent by Almighty God to enlighten the sinners.
My brothers and sisters, I have been sent by Almighty God, the Blessed and Holy Trinity, to enlighten those who believe that they are saved. My brothers and sisters, your salvation is confirmed by your lifestyles today. Are you living according to Almighty Gods, the Unchangeable Ones, holy words, which flow so eloquently through the Bible? My brothers and sisters, do not be deceived or fooled by Satan, the deceiving realm. In order for one to enjoy the gift of salvation, one must, at all times, exhibit the acts and works of Jesuss version of a Christian. Out of divine mercy for his loved ones on earth today, our Perfect, Unchanging Lord has sent his messenger (Barbara) to recite his holy words in your worthy presence. Because of his great generosity, he has deemed this generation worthy to hear his holy words pertaining to salvation, through his modern-day messenger (Barbara). In the midst of this very tragic period, Almighty God has graced this generation with his holy presence in a tangible form (Barbara) so that those whom he has called and chosen will see his glorious light in the midst of Satans, the worlds, realm of darkness. Behold, my brothers and sisters! Behold the generosity of our caring and merciful God! For he is truly in our midst today. Hallelujah!
