  <title>Worshipping Christ Jesus to Usher in the New Millennium - Purpose, Miss Destiny</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Worshipping Christ Jesus to Usher in the New Millennium: Withstanding in the Second Heaven in The End Times&lt;/I&gt; takes seriously the threats that the powers of this world make against all who seek to worship the one true God. The author, Miss Wemys O.L. Small, known as Destiny and Purpose, was born again in 1980. She credits her work and witness since then to the Lord Jesus Christ and gives Him the glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resting upon the inspiration that comes from Jesus Christ, &lt;I&gt;Worshipping Christ Jesus to Usher in the New Millennium&lt;/i&gt; explains the origins of the principalities and powers that oppose Him at every turn, the triumph of His resurrection from the dead, the ways that Christians can stand firm against opposing forces, and the necessity of worshipping and working with other believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have seen at least a bit of what the forces opposed to the Lord can do in your life, in the relations among members of your community, and to the foundations of our shared culture, then &lt;I&gt;Worshipping Christ Jesus to Usher in the New Millennium&lt;/i&gt; can give you the practical, yet spiritual guidance you need to strengthen your trust in Jesus Christ. With this support, you will be able to do exactly as the subtitle states, so that the coming Lord will find you standing firm in the second heaven in the end times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
