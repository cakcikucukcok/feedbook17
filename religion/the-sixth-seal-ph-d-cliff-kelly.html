  <title>The Sixth Seal - Ph.D. Cliff Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book on the end times is sure to intrigue all. Just read what Kelly&amp;#39;s endorsers had to say about his book and purchase your copy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Entire forests have been cut down to provide paper for books on the end times, especially since the publication of The Late Great Planet Earth, by Hal Lindsey in the 1970s.&amp;nbsp;Very few of them have combined piercing biblical exegesis with a broad understanding of the cultural and political situation in the world as a whole. In The Sixth Seal, Cliff Kelly provides a brilliant biblical understanding of the entire basis of the concept of &amp;lsquo;end times,&amp;rsquo; as well as of the political and cultural challenges facing the body of Christ and the entire human race&amp;nbsp;all over the world. No matter what kind of Millennialist you are, Kelly&amp;rsquo;s book makes more sense of the Scriptures and current global actuality than anything you are likely to read in the near future.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash; Dr. David Aikman, author and journalist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cliff Kelly&amp;rsquo;s Sixth Seal is the easiest to understand and most plausible explanation of Biblical eschatology that I have ever read or heard. &amp;nbsp;Those who are just beginning to study this most difficult finale of Scripture will appreciate a clear foundation with which to compare other interpretations. &amp;nbsp;And those who are familiar with eschatology should find plenty to consider. &amp;nbsp;Cliff&amp;rsquo;s vivid writing style, references and quotes from extensive reading supplement this fascinating subject. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps God made such a terrifying series of events intriguing so that we would study it, and be more prepared for what God warns us is going to happen.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Pamela Jason, professor of political science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
