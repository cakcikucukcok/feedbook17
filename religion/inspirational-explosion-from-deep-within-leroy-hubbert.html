  <title>Inspirational Explosion from Deep Within - Leroy Hubbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A question was asked in my dream sometime in January 2014, but blessings of his word that I might share it came in the morning hours that led up to making new changes once again. Amen!
As one hand reaches out to close the doors of inequity and despair, the other hand (right hand) of fellowship is extended to grasp a sincere understanding of joy, knowing the desires of your dreams are at hand. As I looked at life and sat in counsel, breathing new levels of hope and deliverance, I found joy in the works that were allotted in this gift of writing. My hopes and dreams is that this book would reach out to touch the lives of many with the understanding that if you give up on your dreams, restoration is not an option leading to a more profitable journey. I have lived every aspect of the words that I write, whether it was on a personal level or vicariously through the struggle of others. This is meant to bring hope to a wide audience and not just focus on one group. My message is one that is simple but of epic proportions when I speak love and encouragement. First learn to love yourself before you can share that love with others. Never settle in contentment when there are other aspirations to bring joy, understanding you are not in this struggle alone." />
