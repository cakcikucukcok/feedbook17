  <title>Kimble Psalms - Anthony T. Kimble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Somewhere in this world is my place.  A comfortable, yet giving place where I belong.  When I close my eyes, I envision myself painting a new world with a sword and paper--recreating life the way I dream it to be.  I&#39;ll fall so deep into narrative that I actually believe it&#39;s real--even go as far as to live the plots and scenes out loud.  Someday...It will live.  I feel only the fret of running out of paper--hear only waves of my thoughts.  I&#39;ll swim to the nearest city and build a ship to set sail limitless possibilities.  Nothing is impossible, irrational, or untouchable.  I&#39;ll write my own checks and sign my name.  The wisdom for my story derive from fact and the idea to write swirls carelessly around in thin air.  I&#39;ll paint the world a distinctive color.  Blue!  Orange!  No--green!  Yes--green.  Where I belong.  I won&#39;t get shunned aside and pinned by bullies or picked last in basketball.  I&#39;ll never have to stand in line to receive a ticket for the biggest show of them all.  Like in the movies--the hero get&#39;s the girl--I&#39;ll be free-dancing around madly.  I&#39;ll create buildings and blow them to shreds.  Take breathe away and give new meanings to death.  The way I envision is solemnly the way I dream it will be." />
