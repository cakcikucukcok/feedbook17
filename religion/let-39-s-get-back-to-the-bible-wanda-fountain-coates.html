      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lets Get Back to the Bible is designed to allow readers to return or explore the content and beautiful text of the Bible. The Bible is the one and only true source of information from God. It gives us a clear and precise blueprint on how to live a lifestyle that is holy and pleasing in the eyes of our heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people live their lives based upon the ideas and the opinions of others, without ever realizing that the purpose for living on this earth is to praise and worship our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The Bible is the answer to every problem that the world has to offer, from family issues to financial issues and beyond. If you spend time reading and studying the Bible, your search for love, peace, and joy can be answered. The Bible is a book that was inspired by God hundreds of years ago, but yet still has unique meaning today. It is uplifting and motivating. Lets Get Back to the Bible is a series of Bible verses that will address many situations in life, along with different passages seeking to inspire readers. The Poetic Prayer will touch the heart of any man or woman. This collection also allows the readers to receive salvation, which is the open entrance to Heaven, giving every soul a final resting place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
