  <title>How God Can Peel an Onion - Penelope Bourdillon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you have a vision? As we are reaching the end of the millennium, there is undoubtedly a search for something that is missing in peoples lives. There are strange things going on in the world that point to a new awakening; personally, I feel that this is a spiritual awakening. When Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed, we saw a hitherto unknown wave of public behavior. This was called mass hysteria, and so it became because the press whipped it up. I am convinced this was because most people were searching for somethingbut they knew not what they want.
Surely, what many people are thirsting for is spiritual fulfillment. For those who have not yet found it, I urge you to read this little book, with an open heart." />
