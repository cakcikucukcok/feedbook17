  <title>Are You a Spiritual Levite? - Donna M. Canada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christians would readily agree that the pastor of a local church has specific religious responsibilities, duties, and obligations owed to the members of his church. Such responsibilities easily can be found in Holy Scripture and are often a favorite topic of discussion among clergy and laity members. However as a member of the congregation of your local church, as one who is not the pastor, have you ever pondered what might be your religious responsibilities, duties, and obligations, owed to your pastor according to Holy Scripture? What does the Word of God require of you as you rely on your pastor to shepherd the congregation and watch over your eternal souls? How does your service in the house of God measure up to the service God required of the Levites of the Old Testament? Is there a place or call for Levitical service in the New Testament Church?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the questions presented in Are You A Spiritual Levite?: The Calling of the New Testament Church Congregation. The book explores the purpose of the Levitical order established by God and the responsibilities and historical relationship the Levites had toward the high priest. This is a query for New Testament congregations to consider their purposes as members of their local church and to measure the quality of their service to their pastor, to their church, and to God against the Word of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
