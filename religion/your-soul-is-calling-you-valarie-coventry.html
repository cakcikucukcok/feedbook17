  <title>Your Soul Is Calling You - Valarie Coventry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A hush came over the audience as Lightening Bear spoke. An arresting figure, over six feet tall with long braids flanking his angular body, he quietly surveyed the audience for several minutes. You could sense that there wasnt one tiny detail that those deep set, hooded eyes missed as his gaze rested thoughtfully on the audience. I see some of you wear eagle feathers in your hats, he said. In our culture, eagle feathers have to be earned and are a mark of the great respect given to that person. You must look amongst your own stories for your answers, he said gently. We cannot help you with your search for your own spirituality, but we will respect your customs and your ways and we are willing to share our knowledge and work together to ensure the survival of our Mother Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first soul call came directly from this experience as a deep, spiritual yearning for information and stories about my own Celtic background and led to my travels up Saint Michaels line in England to many sacred sites. The second soul call came later, when I picked up one of Brian Weisss books and knew, without a shadow of doubt, that I would train with him in America and take his regression work with me to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book begins with my own story and the healing that his workshop brought to me and goes on to include regression stories from those that I have worked with  real stories about real people. My hope is that these inspirational stories will encourage people to make their own journeys of connection  wherever that may lead them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its very gratifying to have our student and colleague, Valarie, continue this work in Australia and write such a delightful book.&lt;/i&gt; Brian L. Weiss, M.D.&lt;/p&gt;" />
