  <title>Today’S Great Taboo . . . Marriage! - Kortia J Cousin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Todays Great Taboo . . . Marriage is written to show married couples just how much society has affected or is trying to affect their marriages. The book answers the hard questions husbands and wives are afraid to discuss! Some of these are about having adulterous relationships outside of marriage and calling it normal. Another is about the fact that it is okay for women to seek intimate emotional comfort from another male besides their husband. More than anything, society portrays sanctified marriage as out of date or just plain unimportant. These are only few of the points that will be discussed. So if your marriage falls into these categories or you believe your marriage is not where it needs to be, then Todays Great Taboo . . . Marriage is for you!&lt;/p&gt;" />
