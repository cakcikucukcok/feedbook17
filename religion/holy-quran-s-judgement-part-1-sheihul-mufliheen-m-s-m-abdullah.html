  <title>Holy Quran’S Judgement – Part 1 - Sheihul Mufliheen M.S.M Abdullah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The five principles, namely the Quran; Hadith; Ijma; Kiyas
and common sense makes and stabilizes the whole of Islam.
I have observed that the writings and commentaries of a few who
are ignorant or are not fully versed in the knowledge of the Quran
and Hadith are taken as the root by a few, who by their writings,
commentaries and orations are propagating ideas that are a
distortion of and in complete variance with the religion of Islam
and thus create Bid`ah amongst the public.
To those who seek genuine and authentic ideas of the
Quran and Hadith, these expositions have become stumbling
blocks. Therefore, I seek to expostulate the basic facts and ideas
with supporting evidences that constitute Islam that I gained by
years of painstaking and difficult research.
The style of writing in this book is much against the traditions
and style adopted in normal book writing. It is not divided
into chapters but mere orations; some ideas are repeated
several times and that too in many different angles. I, therefore
seek your indulgence and patience to read and understand and do
not come to conclusions by just going through parts of the book.
The contractual obligations between you the reader and
me is that if you are a Mumin who fully believes in Allah and
Rasool (Quran and Hadith) then study this book, if not do not
lay hands on this book." />
