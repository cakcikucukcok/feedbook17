  <title>She Flies On - Carter Heyward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Carter&#39;s words:
I’m persuaded by decades of teaching in seminary and work as a priest in the church that countless women, and many men as well, are faithful “Jesus people” and yet alienated to various degrees from organized religion.  Jack Spong and Barbara Brown Taylor are two of the better known voices who have spoken to these people. This book of mine will probably stand with theirs in appealing to this large  and diverse group of Jesus people who have become “post Christians,”  “cultural Christians,” or have simply drifted away from the church.
 “She Flies On,” however is not really a critique of organized religion, but  rather an effort to think theologically, politically, socially, and  autobiographically about the world and the church into which I was born 70  years ago and have lived and worked as a Christian feminist theologian of  liberation,  who is also an Episcopal priest, a lesbian, a Southerner, and a  socialist Democrat.  So, while the book does in fact critique the church –  especially its foundational doctrine of the Trinity – its rationale is less about  the church and more about the people – and creatures – of God going about  our lives on planet earth, trying to love one another in the 21st century C.E." />
