  <title>Insanity: God and the Theory of Knowledge - Jonah Haddad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you seen such men--peculiar, raving, foam-mouthed, and straitjacketed--throwing themselves mercilessly at white padded walls . . . ? Such men are said to be insane. But there is more to insanity than the images depicted in film and planted in our minds by popular media. Insanity is a condition that affects us all. Unsoundness of mind disrupts our ability to think clearly and to form knowledge about the world. Our understanding is dangerously incomplete and our minds are corrupt. We are all insane. How then can we ever hope to know our world? Is it possible to form justified true beliefs about anything? What possibility, if any, do we have of escaping this condition of madness that keeps us from the light of knowledge? In Insanity, Jonah Haddad explores these very questions by introducing the main problems of the theory of knowledge and by offering a response to our madness--a response grounded in God, the ultimate Knower." />
