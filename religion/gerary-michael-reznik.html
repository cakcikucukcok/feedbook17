  <title>Gerary - Michael Reznik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A life story of a Middle-Ages Jewish scholar, who was so perfect, that his very birth needed a supernatural intervention. The scholar is to experience a long, convoluted chain of ordeals, misfortunes and adventures in order to accomplish the mission of his life. However, the book is concluded by happy end, as the hero succeeds ultimately to bring salvation of blood libels and pogroms to the Jewry of entire kingdom. 
The book &quot;Gerary&quot; emerged from the legend narrated by my late father at my early childhood. The publicity of &quot;Gerary&quot; began back at 1992, in Russian language, on Israeli soil. Lot of people told me after having read &quot;Gerary&quot; that that reading was one of the best experiences of their life. Some of readers shared with me their secret that the optimism radiated by &quot;Gerary&quot; helped them to overcome a deep personal psychological crisis, being caused by whatever circumstances: political, or romantic, financial or medical. Major Israeli newspapers reprinted great parts of this book, in Russian, as well as in Hebrew; but only at 2012 &quot;Gerary&quot; had finally reached the world-wide tribune, through AuthorHouse&#39;s advanced publishing technology, and its highly professional, dedicated personnel." />
