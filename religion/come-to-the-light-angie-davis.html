  <title>Come to the Light - Angie Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angies faith in God and the walk she takes with Him in her daily life is an inspiration to everyone she touches. Her spoken and written words always make for a better day. Sis, you are a ray of sunshine on any day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Conley, receptionist, animal hospital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The author, Angie Davis, has been a friend of mine for thirty years. I have seen her grow in faith and wisdom over the years and learn to share what gifts God has given her. She is a faithful servant of the Lord and is a walking, living, breathing, testimony to how He speaks to her in everyday life. I treasure our friendship and have been blessed by her presence in my life. God has blessed her with the gift of writing, and I pray that her devotions will bless others the way they have blessed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pam Heidig, homemaker, artist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I read something from Angie Davis every day. She writes devotions from real life experience that reflects a true Christian walk, whether the road is rocky or smooth. To say I receive encouragement from Angie is an understatement. It is obvious God is using her in the lives of others through her writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Lehman, stay-at-home-mom, musician&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The devotions in Come to the Light are written mostly from events experienced by author Angie Davis, her family, and her friends. She shares this book in hopes that it will encourage your heart and strengthen your faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
