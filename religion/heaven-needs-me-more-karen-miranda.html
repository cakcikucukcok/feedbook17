  <title>Heaven Needs Me More - Karen Miranda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My manuscript is a very sensitive subject. It is about spirit children, teenagers, and young adults. This book is their stories, and it is written to let me share with you that they are not silent on the other side. They have a lot to communicate with me to their loved ones who are still here on the earth. Each story has a special message that they wanted to send to their family and friendsmessages of healing and love and messages letting them know that they are OK on the other side and that they are not alone.
In this book, you will see a sketch of some of the spirit children, teenagers, and young adults in some of the stories. These are just quick sketches illustrating how they are not perfect. It is how the spirits presented themselves to me, and their family could identify them. I have had no knowledge of what they looked like beforehand.
In this book, you will also read about bullying, suicide, and depression, which can be very hard for the families that have been left behind. You will also read about some of my personal experiences that I have had with seeing heaven. As you continue on with my spiritual journey with me, you will also read how my spirit art came to be a part of me being a spirit medium. I have some meditations to share with you in my book and my life in the convent as a nunthe eight stages of grief, writing a letter to a loved one who has passed away, being a platform and medium giving messages in Sunday services to a congregation of people, and delivering messages as a spirit medium. I am also an independent producer; I do a live show where I take phone calls from the person that calls up looking for a spirit reading, and I also give spiritual insights to the people who are watching my show, Whispers from the Other Side." />
