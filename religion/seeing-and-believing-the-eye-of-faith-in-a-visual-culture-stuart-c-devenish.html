  <title>Seeing and Believing: The Eye of Faith in a Visual Culture - Stuart C. Devenish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a cinematic culture where multiple visions of reality play at the same time, it is critical that Christian believers know how to confidently identify and discern, among other stories, the Jesus-story that defines their most important commitment in life. Using the optical metaphor of the eye of faith, the author identifies the spiritual life as a visual life. Through themes such as looking through Jesus&#39; eyes, the bible as a visionary text, and the church as a wide-eyed people, he builds a connecting bridge between the seeing-soul in Christian spirituality, and the twenty-first century as the age of the eye. The key words for this exploration are spirituality, discipleship, insight, luminescence, and optical therapy. The author proposes the need for a catechism of the eye that will lead to the renewal of Christian ministry, spirituality, discipleship, and identity." />
