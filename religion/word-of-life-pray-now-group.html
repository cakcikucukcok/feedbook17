  <title>Word of Life - Pray Now Group</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Word of Life is a fresh and inspiring collection of newly written prayer and prayer meditations that can be used by individuals, prayer groups and leaders of worship in all denominations.
The book aims to give readers a place to start when they feel they have no words of their own, encouraging them to find time to think and space to listen. It is a way into prayer for many and is designed to help people pray and learn to pray.
Based on the Church of Scotland&#39;s Heart &amp; Soul theme for the year, each chapter includes:
* scripture readings
* prayers for morning and evening 
* a short meditation
* a blessing 
The theme recalls the dynamic and creative logos, the divine word as &#39;that which makes things happen&#39;. It traces this creative power through all life&#39;s stages.
The book is arranged in seven sections which explore and reflect on the divine faithfulness through life: Conception, Birth, Early years, Growing, Maturing, Later Life and The Last Word." />
