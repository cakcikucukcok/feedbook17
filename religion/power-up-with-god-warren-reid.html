  <title>Power up with God - Warren Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How precious is the Word of God? Jesus said in Matthew 4:4 that Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Yet though Gods Word is precious and nourishing to our hearts, minds, and souls, so few of us know it and know how to apply it. 
Power Up with God hopes to remedy this deficiency and help believers get the benefits of applying every word of God. We can read or hear the words from the preachers pulpit, but we will gain nothing until we begin to eat the Word of God. The adage You are what you eat is true in both the physical and spiritual worlds, and unless we eat the Word of God, we can become weak and sickeven to the point of death.
If we go without food and water, we will become weak. And because we cannot live by bread alone, if we go without the spiritual nourishment of Gods Word, then we will become spiritually malnourished. Therefore, it is essential to read, study, and apply the teachings of the Word, and Power Up with God will show you how to devote yourself to this spiritual diet and make your life happy and prosperous." />
