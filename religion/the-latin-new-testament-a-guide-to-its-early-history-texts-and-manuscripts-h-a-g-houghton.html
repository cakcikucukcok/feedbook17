  <title>The Latin New Testament: A Guide to its Early History, Texts, and Manuscripts - H. A. G. Houghton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Latin is the language in which the New Testament was copied, read, and studied for over a millennium. The remains of the initial &#39;Old Latin&#39; version preserve important testimony for early forms of text and the way in which the Bible was understood by the first translators. Successive revisions resulted in a standard version subsequently known as the Vulgate which, along with the creation of influential commentaries by scholars such as Jerome and Augustine, shaped
theology and exegesis for many centuries. Latin gospel books and other New Testament manuscripts illustrate the continuous tradition of Christian book culture, from the late antique codices of Roman North Africa and Italy to the glorious creations of Northumbrian scriptoria, the pandects of the
Carolingian era, eleventh-century Giant Bibles, and the Paris Bibles associated with the rise of the university.
In The Latin New Testament, H.A.G. Houghton provides a comprehensive introduction to the history and development of the Latin New Testament. Drawing on major editions and recent advances in scholarship, he offers a new synthesis which brings together evidence from Christian authors and biblical manuscripts from earliest times to the late Middle Ages. All manuscripts identified as containing Old Latin evidence for the New Testament are described in a catalogue, along with those featured
in the two principal modern editions of the Vulgate. A user&#39;s guide is provided for these editions and the other key scholarly tools for studying the Latin New Testament." />
