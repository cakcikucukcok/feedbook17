  <title>Incorporating Children in Worship: Mark of the Kingdom - Michelle A. Clifton-Soderstrom, David Bjorlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Incorporating children in worship is a powerful and overlooked mark of God&#39;s kingdom. This book argues that children&#39;s full participation in worship signifies not only a vibrant, faithful communion but also offers a critical window into the Spirit&#39;s work of linking the church to Christ. Children have a vocation in worship. They embody the theological virtues in distinct ways that enrich the worship of the whole church. Moreover, incorporating children reflects the difference in unity that is God&#39;s triune life. Receiving children in their difference moves the worshipping body toward the telos of worship--glorification of God and sanctification of humanity--and habituates the worshipping body to incorporate other, often more threatening, kinds of difference." />
