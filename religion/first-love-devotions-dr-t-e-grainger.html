  <title>First Love Devotions - Dr. T.E. Grainger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;First Love Devotions is written from the authors rich experience of over fifty years as a pastor and teacher. One of the dangers a pastor faces is becoming mechanical and professional and losing the first love that motivated him to devote his life as a servant of God. The best safeguard against that is maintaining a loving, intimate daily fellowship with Jesus as you seek his guidance in understanding the scripture. If you find your love for Jesus waning, do a thorough job of repentance as you renew and cultivate this relationship. Each first-love devotion treats a passage of scripture and gives insight based on prayerful reflection as it relates to personal experience. In addition to personal spiritual benefits, the Christian worker will find a wealth of topics, sermon prompts, and illustrative materials that may be shared with others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
