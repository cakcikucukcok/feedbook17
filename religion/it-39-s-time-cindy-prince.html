  <title>It&#39;s Time - Cindy Prince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does it really make a difference to God how we worship Him? Do you think He cares? Is there a way to know for sure? Should evidence matter when were walking by faith? Is the God who created the universe still in the business of changing lives?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Its Time is the story that answers Yes! to all of the above. It is the journey of a family of seven, devoted to a religion they loved and had no intention of ever leavingbut God had other plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dive in and discover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how God opens the door, scoops them up, and redirects their path;&lt;br /&gt;how the Spirit uses everything from casual conversations to major life events to reveal His truth and guide their journey;&lt;br /&gt;how He uses seeds that had been planted long before the day He said, Its time; and&lt;br /&gt;how He repeatedly answers the prayers they dared not express, in the way that only He could have known their hearts needed, leading them to the grace of His unconditional love.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Let it encourage, enlighten, and remind you that we serve a mighty God. He cares, He calls, and He has given us everything we need to respond through His Word and His Spiritand He doesnt stop there. &lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths (Proverbs 3:56)&lt;/p&gt;" />
