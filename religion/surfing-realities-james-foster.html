  <title>Surfing Realities - James Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What am I doing here, and why doesnt life make any sense? Who am I, and what does it all mean, anyway? Through &lt;i&gt;Surfing Realities&lt;/i&gt;, James Foster provides answers to these questions with precise pragmatism. Foster argues that there are no lasting answers and that nothing makes sense for those asking these profound questions because the context we have learned to accept is inaccurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By deciphering and condensing thousands of hours of information received from Ascended Beings of Light through internationally known channel Nasrin Safai, Foster paints a vast landscape expanding our perspective to embrace a cosmic context. Through a step-by-step process, we gain greater understanding of how the game is really played on cosmic as well as personal levels and how it all blends together in a beautiful cosmic dance. A logical presentation of the nature of reality is given with practical tools to improve our own reality and that of our loved ones, earth and humankind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surfing Realities&lt;/i&gt; covers a myriad of subjects including the history of this planet, the rise and fall of its civilizations, the expanse of the cosmos, the dimensions of reality, our hierarchy of beings, universal law, and the nature of duality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
