  <title>The Scapegoat - Prophetess Daphne R. Grayson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I write these words I would say forgiveness is the most powerful spiritual tool one can take with them on their life journey.  While in Maryland ministering at my very first out of state meeting is where God through the Holy Spirit taught me about forgiveness. When one refuses to forgive and allows un-forgiveness to reign in their heart it will literally paralyze them from moving into the true blessings God has for them. Life becomes more tainted one might say. In Matthew 9:2 we see Jesus healing a man from palsy (paralyze) the first thing he says to him was take up thy bed and walk thy sins have been forgiven.  Jesus knew the cause of his crippling state, and forgiveness was the answer.  When speaking to the people there he said, what&#39;s easier to forgive him or say take up thy bed and walk? He was stagnated and could not move because of unforgiveness and lay there without hope. Whatever the sin was it was not the problem it did its job. That was to stop him from moving forward in life.  His life had altered its course he had become stuck. The life force of his spirit had stop until Jesus the life giver came.  I can remember the day that Jesus came into my life giving me mercy here I stood a sinner and now my sins have been forgiven or pardon.  There is a song that said, When I could not reach mercy, mercy came running to me Jesus has come to us.  Glory! So just as you have been forgiven you too must forgive all those in your past that has hurt, disappointed you causing you to become stagnated in your life.  Jesus the giver of life is here!" />
