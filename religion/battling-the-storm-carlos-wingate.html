  <title>Battling the Storm - Carlos Wingate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a man who, in his heart, found himself convicted by God and wanted to get his life back on track. Along his journey God revealed Himself and gave him insight and understandings well beyond what he had ever hoped for. Because God repaired his fractured life and restored his soul, he felt an obligation to share his testimony and to pass this information along to all who will read it to help them to do the same. What he found out was that the world is not what it portrays itself to be. Many struggle and have no clue as to why they are struggling and furthermore have no clue where to begin to right their ship. This book puts God, your life and this world into a perspective that is easily understood so that you can withstand any storm that life may throw your way. It reveals things within Christianity that has been misunderstood and brings about clarity and enlightenment to your everyday living. This is not a book of fairytale or fantasy, it is rooted in reality. It does not sell a dream of health and wealth but what it does is show you the way to achieving a peaceful life. Religion can enslave you and have you living in fear of eternal damnation just as many other things in this world. It can also inspire, empower and liberate you from anything that attempts to contain or control you. This book is designed to inspire, empower and liberate you so that this life and the afterlife can be enjoyed and not feared. It reveals a simple, common sense, no nonsense way to your future destiny. You are all invited and welcomed to take this life changing journey." />
