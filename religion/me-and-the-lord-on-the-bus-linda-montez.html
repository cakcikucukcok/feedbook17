  <title>Me and the Lord on the Bus - Linda Montez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Winter roads were unusually icy in San Antonio, and schools
had already cancelled classes more than once. Linda Montez
decided to take the bus to work. She soon realized the bus
was more than a mode of transportation. For her, it was an avenue
for ministry.
Linda tells 30 stories about the people she met on the bus, the situations she
encountered, and the insights she gained. Through times of joy,
fear, prayer, laughter, and also the quietly contemplative, she eagerly
anticipated her next new acquaintance. The Lord used what was very
ordinary to bring extraordinary blessings.
Serving the Lord requires that we do not limit Him. No particular
college degree necessary. No need to wait for an official mission trip.
And certainly that we do not rule out possibilities because theyre
outside the box. Like something so ordinary as riding a city bus.
For Linda, riding the bus brought unmatched thrill
and amazement.
Whether you read this book all at once or as a daily devotional,
may you be encouraged to look for God in your daily living. May
you see Him orchestrate people and circumstances.
May we all show up ready to the Lords call and watch Him work." />
