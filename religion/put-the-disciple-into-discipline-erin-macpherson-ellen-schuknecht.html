  <title>Put the Disciple into Discipline - Erin MacPherson, Ellen Schuknecht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUT THE DISCIPLE INTO DISCIPLINE gives parents the tools they need to truly disciple their kids through their most trying discipline situations.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What do you say when your kid has really messed up?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you respond when your three-year-old is throwing pennies at other carts as you walk through the aisles at Target? Or when your eight-year-old daughter rolls her eyes in a dramatic fit of preteen angst? Or when your sixteen-year-old son is lying as he attempts to go somewhere that he never should be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are the tough moments in parenting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they are also the moments that will define your kids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We want to give parents the tools they need to truly disciple their kids through their most trying discipline situations. With these tools, parents can guide their kids&#39; hearts towards the God who loves them deeply, and survive those pull-out-your-hair parenting moments. We pray that&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;PUT THE DISCIPLE INTO DISCIPLINE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;will help parents to connect with their kids in a heartfelt way so that their kids, in turn, can connect with the God who created them to be truly and imperfectly His." />
