  <title>Help Me! I’M a Religious Wreck and You Can Find Me in the Desert - Tamara K. Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyday countless numbers of believers experience crisis that tests their faith. Once thrust into the storm, the sifting begins, and we must make a choice to stand on truth. To complicate the matter, we may respond in sin and continue in error by pointing the blame on others. After our faith falters through a trial, we may abandon it and suffer the stigma of what the Apostle Paul called, a shipwrecked faith. Not understanding why this happens to loyal believers, who once felt so close to God, we turn away from our faith. Like spiritual nomads, we leave the congregation, fleeing for refuge in a desert of our own making. What we may not comprehend, or appreciate is that Gods grace sustains us during our season of separation. This book helps the reader to regain stability during a stretch in the desert and see it as an opportunity for refining and redefining our faith. 
Alternatively, faith failure occurs when a believer naively misplaces faith to truth in a system of religious works, or persons and suffers when they do not uphold the teachings of Jesus. When we walk from false religious teachings, associates label us as failures and reject us. Broken hearted and disillusioned by our situation, we give up our religion and turn our back on everything we once believed in. We may spend years hiding in the desert making little progress in our faith, until we realize that we are spiritually thirsty. We long for Gods love and wish someone would help us find the way to restore our faith. Our cry is like the title of this book, Help Me! Im a Religious Wreck and You Can Find Me in the Desert and here it is with care, placed into your hands, from one who understands the cry." />
