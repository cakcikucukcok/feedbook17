      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surprisingly Supernatural: A Practical Guide to Releasing the Gifts of the Spirit&lt;/em&gt; teaches believers to receive the gifts of the Spirit, and then how to release the spiritual gifts of prophecy, healings and miracles, discernment, and binding or driving out demons. Then the believers are encouraged to bring in the harvest. When believers learn how to release the gifts of the Spirit that is what the Bride of Christ is to do at the end of the age, and then she will enter into the wedding banquet (see Matt. 24:14; 25:9-10).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You Will Learn&lt;/p&gt;
That you are supposed to ask for the Holy Spirit, and ask for the gifts of the Spirit, and being continually filled by the Spirit was what the first disciples experienced, and they were the first ones called Christians. 
That if you will learn the conditions required for you to hear Gods voice, then you will be able to prophecy. 
That if you will learn the keys to healing, then you will begin to see the sick healed when you lay your hands on them. 
That when you ask for the gift of discernment, then you will begin to discern demons and the defilement that is around you. Then you can cast out those demons. 
That leylines are spiritual highways that demons travel on over the earth, and you will learn how to clean them off. 
That when you release the gifts of the Spirit, you will easily be able to show nonbelievers that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and is the Savior of the World. 
That the Bride of Christ is to be continually filled by the Spirit until she is clothed in the armor of light and clothed in Jesus Christ, then she will bring glory to the Lord (see Rom. 13:12, 14)" />
