  <title>From Tribulations to Restoration - Debra Sanders Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone seeking to live a godly life will suffer some oppression; this mission is inescapable. Therefore, we ought not to be amazed when it comes. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf (1 Peter 4:16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God has the answers to all our problems and is always true to his word. But He never put a time frame on it. He is never in a hurry! There is nothing we can do to speed him up, nor help him out. We must wait! Pain and suffering teach us not only to wait on God but to trust his timing. Trusting His timing helps to solidify our faith and enhance our spiritual progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just when things look hopeless, and the future looks uninviting, God will show up and show his powers. God is in full control. Waiting on God requires faith and a whole lot of patience. Dont become weary in well doing for God has promised to reward those who wait on him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Tribulations to Restoration is an inspiring spiritual handbook that is designed to help believers face difficulties faithfully. The author, Debra Sanders Clark, encourages readers to trust Gods Word and provision to get through lifes most difficult moments. After reading this book, readers will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-evaluate their lives and their relationship with Christ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-understand Gods unconditional love, His faithfulness and His promises&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;-become empowered, to grow spiritually&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;During difficult times, we are encouraged to remain faithful and trust God. Because one day soon the waves will subside and suddenly we will find ourselves on the other side of the storm. Then we can shout, thank you Lord, I made it over, I couldnt made this journey without you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
