  <title>The Director’S Cut - Erik L. Strandness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Believer and unbeliever alike are subtly evangelized every day of their lives by the ambient glow of Gods cinematic masterpiece. They sense something grand but are confused by the incoherent cultural edits scattered throughout the film. The Good News is that the deleted scenes are not lost but can be found in our shared human experiences, and once spliced back together reveal an epic of Biblical proportions, The Directors Cut of the Greatest Story Ever Told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Erik Strandness takes a unique bottom up approach to apologetics by investigating experiences common to all people and concluding that they can only be adequately understood through a Biblical filter. The goal is to empower lay Christians to condently share their faith in a concrete, friendly, real-world context that effectively engages the day-to-day realities of their audience. Dr. Strandness writes in a clear, engaging, and witty style, combining the thoughts of many great Christian thinkers with culturally relevant illustrations in order to make a solid real world case for the Christian worldview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in a while, someone manages to put ageless truth in such a fresh package that it cries out, Read on! Thats the way I felt when reviewing Erik Strandnesss book. What a pleasure it is to read! But its not just Eriks engaging word images that make it such a great read. Its the profound and timely message he is communicating in such an intelligent and winsome way. This is a book you will be telling others about.&lt;/p&gt;
