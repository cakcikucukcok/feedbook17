  <title>Buddha’S Tooth - U. C. Fate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="U. C. Fate has only one little thing to do before he dies. That is, to kill God. The novel opens on the very day Fate has scheduled for this public execution. We are in Sri Lanka, at the Buddhist Temple of the Tooth during Esala Perahera (the sacred procession of the Tooth Relic.) But a not-so-simple twist of fate interrupts U. C. Fates plans. God easily escapes, while Fate himself is killed (and by a pious mob of monks, no less.) Yet, instead of experiencing death, our protoplasmic protagonist is rescued by an unasked-for Resurrection. U. C. Fate instantly Awakens; both with God Consciousness and a far better sense of humor. From here, all the way to the hereafter, U. C. Fate goes on a Magical Mythos Tour. He revisits thousands of years of religious history, each of his steps on this Inter and Intra-Religious journey are taken while wearing satiric slippers. Culture, chronology, and traditional time simply lose their fixed frames as Ancient Greeks, modern Rock n Rollers, Catholic Conquistas of Spain, and present day Mormons, argue with tribal American Indians over whose Truth is True. The Incarnated God Quetzalcatl is also here to fulfill Meso-American prophecy (i.e. The Second Coming only salsa style.) After this cosmic Love connection we come to the long awaited meeting with The Buddha. Buddhas Paradiso bridge is only open for Open-Ended-BeginningsThis means U. C. Fate must return Buddhas Tooth! He does so, thereby restoring every religion to their Rightful Rites." />
