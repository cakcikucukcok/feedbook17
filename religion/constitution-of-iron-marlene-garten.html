  <title>Constitution of Iron - Marlene Garten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is nothing more powerful than a dream from God. It can stir you, push you, and even transform you into His messenger of hope. So often, once we receive the dream, vision, or prophetic word for our lives, we fail to realize the process that comes next. Nobody ever prophesies about the quiet days!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I believe that author Marlene Garten has produced a masterful message in her book, &lt;em&gt;Constitution of Iron&lt;/em&gt;. This book takes you on a journey from the dream to the pit, then the palace, then the prison, and finally back to the palace. It will take you from point A to point C! Remember this one rule: God always reveals, reverses, and then restores! In the book &lt;em&gt;Constitution of Iron&lt;/em&gt;, we are taught that regardless of what others think or how they may harm your calling, God still has a plan. This book is destined to be a classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Pat Schatzline, evangelist, Mercy Seat Ministries, author of &lt;em&gt;Why Is God So Mad at Me?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;I Am Remnant!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside these pages is the story of Joseph and his dream. His story has been told many times. Nevertheless, God wants to encourage you to trust Him to bring your dream to pass. If God planted a dream in your heart, I believe that He is saying to you that its never too late, youre never too old, youre never too young, and as long as you are still breathing, dream fulfillment is only a trial away. He is urging us to look at Josephs dream and trials again as if looking at them for the first time. Surely his experience is an example of the perseverance needed to make dreams come true. After all, who said it was going to be easy?&lt;/p&gt;" />
