  <title>The 19 Cent Millionaire - Marian Wardlaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which I must stop and look fear in the face.  I say to myself, Ive lived through this and I can take the next thing that comes along.
                                                                                            --Eleanor Roosevelt
The trials, challenges, and lessons of life seem to do one of two things; they either make us or break us.  In addition, the way we think on a daily basis plays a major role in how we face the challenges of life and ultimately grow from each of the individual obstacles that come our way.  In dealing with setbacks, it is then that our will, determination, and true character are tested at every level.  Many questions prevail in such turbulent timesDo we wallow in self pity? or Do we keep pressing on knowing and believing that better days are to come?  Do we give up on our faith and simply throw in the towel? of Do we continue to believe that God is working in our lives even when we cant see HIM working?
The 19 Cent Millionaire is a story of how an ordinary woman, with the help of family, friends, and even complete strangers, has dealt with and triumphed over difficult circumstances and reveals what she has learned in the process.  This book is a story of hope for all who have ever felt lost and alone, abused and forgotten, or thought themselves to be too far gone for a positive change.  It is a story of how one woman has learned, grown, and is still growing into the woman she has always wanted to be and the mission she has to help others reach their full potential and obtain Gods ultimate best." />
