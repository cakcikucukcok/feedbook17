  <title>The Dragonfly Spirit - Susan Brunell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After her twenty-year-old daughter dies in an automobile accident the author finds herself on a journey of grief that, until then, she could not even imagine.  As she travels down this path, that has been determined for her, she learns about death and its effect on her life and the lives of others she loves. 
This is a story about learning to grow and cope despite great loss.  Its also about opening the heart and mind to possibilities for healing and growth.  Tools to understand the process and deal with the tragedy of loss are offered for the grieving and their loved ones. 
This is not a story about death. Its about trying to understand death, and how it affects our lives.  Its about a journey that no parent chooses to take. Its about learning to live life to its fullest while searching for Peace." />
