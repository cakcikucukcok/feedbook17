  <title>Looking to Christ: the Book of Hebrews - Marci Ogrosky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Get ready to make the book of Hebrews your new favorite book of the Bible with the help of Looking to Christ, an insightful evangelical study guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be encouraged to keep the faith by focusing on the person and work of Jesus Christ, imitating the faith of Old Testament heroes, and putting your faith into practice in spite of the challenges and doubts you face. As your assurance of faith grows stronger, you will be better prepared to joyfully persevere throughout life, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every lesson in Looking to Christ gives background information, asks questions, and applies the truth of Scripture with a common-sense approach that makes Hebrews accessible to all levels of Bible students. Allow yourself to be transformed from the inside out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fill your mind with the truth of who Christ is and what He has done.  Let your heart be inspired by the example of faithful believers.  Give evidence of faith by your attitude and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this is your first time studying Hebrews or your twentieth, there are always new and deeper insights waiting for you. It is time to grab your Bible and a pen, sit down with Looking to Christ, and expect good things.&lt;/p&gt;" />
