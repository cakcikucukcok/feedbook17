  <title>She Is Everywhere! Volume 3 - Mary Beth Moser, Mary Saracino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;She Is Everywhere! Volume 3 &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;presents a bold, brave, and beautiful compilation of womanist/feminist essays, poems, and artwork showcasing work from an international community of women and men who honor the Sacred Female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifty contributors in this anthologyscholars, creative writers, and visual artistsshare their vision for a world that reclaims the inviolability of the Divine Female in all Her many and varied manifestations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;She Is Everywhere! Volume 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the latest edition of a leading-edge series which, like its predecessors, offers an invaluable contribution to womens spirituality, religion, philosophy, and womens studies. The contemporary voices contained within its pages echo an ancient clarion call to embrace the values of justice with compassion, equality for all people, and transformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We have a calling in this worldnamely, to prevent the destruction from continuing. &lt;br&gt;
Claudia von Werlhof&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I am in the presence of a divine Mother, and She is fulfilling a deep longing inside of me. &lt;br&gt;
Nicole Margiasso-Tran&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She was, I am, my daughter is because we are all Her. &lt;br&gt;
Etoyle McKee&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Just as dark matter (mother) in space shapes galaxies and holds them together, we are shaped and held by the African Dark Mother who has given us Her life force, and resides in the very depths of our being, where the macrocosm is literally reflected in the microcosm. &lt;br&gt;
