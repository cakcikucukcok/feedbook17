  <title>The Moment After - James Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This letter will allow us to be able to look down the corridor of life. To see the end result of a wrong choice of direction, where the ability to change is no longer available, while still standing in a time where change can be made. 
	To recall moments in life, where decisions were made, to later find that it took us down a road that led to worse times. The difference between those times and the point in this letter is; as long as we are living, the decisions we make, weather bad or good, we can set our mind, buckle down for the ride, and ride it out because better days will come. Even prison, some live to do the time and get out. Many other things can be worked out, gotten over, or pressed through as long as we live. The point in this letter is stressing the fact that there is no chance of change after we die. The course in which we choose is set then." />
