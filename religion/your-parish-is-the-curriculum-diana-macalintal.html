  <title>Your Parish Is the Curriculum - Diana  Macalintal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;We all agree that the community needs to be involved in the RCIA. So we make bulletin and Mass announcements explaining the rites and the RCIA process, hoping the parishioners will &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; their responsibility to initiate these seekers. Then, although catechumens, candidates, sponsors, and team members form a tight-knit community, parishioners still wonder who these people are with their rituals that make the Mass long and most of the newly initiated still disappear from the parish after Easter.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Taking to heart what the United States bishops said in their document on adult faith formation&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;While the parish may &lt;I&gt;have an&lt;/I&gt; adult faith formation program, it is no less true that the parish &lt;I&gt;is&lt;/I&gt; an adult faith formation program&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Diana Macalintal argues that we have to stop trying to get the parish involved in the RCIA and start getting the catechumens and candidates involved in the parish.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In this book, readers will discover:1. why doing the RCIA in the midst of the community not only forms seekers into disciples but renews the conversion of the entire parish; 2. what parishioners can do to take responsibility for the initiation of adults, without adding another meeting to their lives; 3. how to use the four key areas of parish life and the liturgical year to introduce seekers to Christ and train them in the Christian way of life; 4. the three levels of catechesis and how to use mystagogical reflection on parish life to provide a systematic and complete catechesis appropriate for each level.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;When you make your parish the RCIA curriculum, you will be shaping not just a group of people but an entire community into lifelong disciples.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
