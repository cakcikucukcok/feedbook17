  <title>Untangled - Angela Gilmour, Laura Fay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re weary, stressed, and wondering what the point is. Where are our sense of joy and purpose? At times, we feel lost in these struggles and desperate to find God&amp;#39;s best for our lives. But--we get tangled up in our emotions. We are distracted by 100 different things and end up feeling empty and wondering if we are truly living out the purpose God intended for us. In this study, we will search the scriptures, talk about our struggles, and practice with clinical tools and techniques to find hope and freedom from these issues and see how God is fitting together the puzzle of our purpose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This study is not about ways to remove your emotions because they are wrong. This study is a discussion about why they are there, how they affect us, and what we can do about them so they don&amp;#39;t entangle us. We want to untangle these emotions, but not remove them. They are a part of our design and a part of our purpose. Cutting out our emotions would be like cutting out our sense of hunger or our ability to see and hear. They are all God-given and we are to use them to sense the needs of those around us and the Holy Spirit in us&lt;/p&gt;" />
