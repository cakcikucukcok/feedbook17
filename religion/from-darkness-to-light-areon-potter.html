  <title>From Darkness to Light - Areon Potter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DEMONIC OPPRESSION IS REAL. &lt;br /&gt;
SPIRITUAL WARFARE IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author Areon Potter knows that Satan, demons, and their ploys have tormented humanity since the Fall. In From Darkness to Light, Areon provides practical tools to effectively arm the reader for spiritual battle. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Discover how the forces of darkness scheme against Gods people. &lt;br /&gt;
 Learn the importance of knowing God and what His names reveal. &lt;br /&gt;
 Discern how to effectively put on the full armor of God. &lt;br /&gt;
 Protect yourself from the attacks of the enemy through prayer. &lt;br /&gt;
 Realize how demonic forces oppress Christians. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Areon and I were in a counseling ministry together when it became very evident that spiritual warfare had to be an integral part of the counseling process. Areon is gifted in this difficult and often neglected ministry of dealing with the demonic. His 30+ years of counseling extremely difficult cases has given him a solid Biblical understanding of this subject. &lt;br /&gt;
Bill Woods, Campus Crusade for Christ JESUS Film Project &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Darkness to Light is a great resource for our times. It gives solid Biblical insights into an arena that most people choose to deny exists. Its an excellent tool for skeptics, and those who feel ill equipped to deal with spiritual warfare. It is a valuable read. &lt;br /&gt;
Pastor David McGarrah, Deer Flat Church, Caldwell, Idaho &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The belief or lack of belief in demonic forces will not change the Biblical fact that demons exist. The Bible speaks of Satan roaming to and fro, searching for whom he may devour. Evil may lurk in the darkness, but hope gleams in the Light. Let From Darkness to Light transform your vision, your choices, and your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
