  <title>Narrow Is the Way - Jay R. Leach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE TRUE CHURCHS FINEST HOUR!
In America today, we are living through the spiritual, social, moral, philosophical, economic, political and personal shifts that have brought down mighty empires and nations in the past. The pseudo change agents behind the shifts are working tirelessly in our society and culture to bring down America. Many believe the church [Christs earthly representative] is facing its darkest hour. However, church history has proven from ancient times what is considered the darkest hour for the church has proven to be the true churchs finest hour.
    The good news is the nerve-wracking uncertainties of our postmodern people, their philosophers and false teachers about the future are being countered by the strong certainties of the God of Creation in the body of truth that He left us  the true Gospel of Jesus Christ found the volume of the Book. In the Bible we discover answers to troubling questions through solid unchanging biblical truth that can be applied to bring stability to us and our institutions. We are promised in Daniel 11:32, But the people who know their GOD shall be strong, and carry out great exploits. The impact of the true church of God is revealed through:
	The prayers of the saints going up before God (see Revelation 5:8).
	The followers of Christ are a royal priesthood (see 1 Peter 2:4-5).
	The followers of Christ standing in the full armor of God, as the day of evil approaches (see Ephesians 6:10, 11, 13-18).
In spite of media bias, Hollywood stereotypes, Spiritless professors and the atheistic attempt toward secularization of the world  the true Church of God victoriously marches onward and upward expanding the Kingdom of God. Narrow is the way!" />
