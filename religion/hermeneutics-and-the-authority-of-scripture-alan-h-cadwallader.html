  <title>Hermeneutics and the Authority of Scripture - Alan H. Cadwallader</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The question of hermeneutics now dominates all disciplines of  human knowledge and its construction. It has moved from a  concentration on how to apply the results of research knowledge  to considerations of the frameworks by which we conduct research  as a meaningful exercise. The study of the Bible is not exempt  from these developments. The essays in this collection amply  testify to the breadth of frameworks that are now being applied  to the Bible and the development of ethical awareness in the  construction of knowledge. The reader will find engagements with  the Bible informed by developments in science, law, ecology,  feminism and linguistics. Key ethical issues about violence,  fundamentalism, anti-semitism and patriarchy are directly  addressed as inextricably involved in the interpretation of the  Bible, on the understanding that both Bible and interpreter must  be responsible and accountable in todays world. Critical analysis  of the Bible is no different, even when there is a  pre-disposition or confessional commitment to treat the bible as  sacred scripture. Biblical research is inextricably affected by  those epistemologies and ethical sensitivities that inform  understanding and the search for meaning in our contemporary  world." />
