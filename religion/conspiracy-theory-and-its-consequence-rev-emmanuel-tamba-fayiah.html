  <title>Conspiracy Theory and Its Consequence - Rev. Emmanuel Tamba Fayiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reverend Emmanuel Tamba Fayiah was born in 1958 to Moslem and African traditional worshipping parents. He is a member of the Kissi/Gissi tribe on the west coast of Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He started in the capital city, Freetown, and completed his high school in Liberia. It was in the city of Freetown where he studied Arabic up to the seventh grade and became a Moslem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, he got saved, got baptized, studied the Christian faith in several Bible institutions and later began to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ after he got his calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the civil war in Liberia in the 90s, he was shot in the arm and later had the opportunity to travel to the United States, where he got a political asylum benefit. He is currently with his wife and four children, leaving one who was missing in action as they were fleeing the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is written based on a series of experiences he had about the consequence of conflict. It expresses and warns the dangers that follow. The evil that men do lives after them has been his emphasis. He had also written his first book, Teachings on the Turbulence of Time in Human Lives, besides two other books that will soon follow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
