  <title>Simply Revelation - Edward L. Brownlee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are signs all around the world that are pointing to the tribulation period to come. Within the last decade, the world has seen a rise in earthquakes, violent storms, hurricanes, and weird weather patterns, and all seem to get worse as each year goes by. We see monetary problems all around the world. We have seen wars and heard rumors of war. Drought and famine have been present in the world or the struggle of power within some nations. We have seen the cruelty of man upon man in this world and how painful it is. As the cup of iniquity of this world rises, so is the coming judgment of this world by God. 
Do you want to know why the antichrist will not rule the world? What is the real reason behind the mark of the beast? How will God send his angels to preach the everlasting Gospel for the last time? Why does Jesus come on a secret mission? How will Jesus, the saints, and angels return to the earth to save Israel? 
The book of Revelation is jam-packed with so much information, and its sometimes hard to understand what it all means. &lt;i&gt;Simply Revelation&lt;/i&gt; breaks down the chapters in Revelation in a way thats easy to understand. Learn what brings on the confirming of the covenant with many nations by the antichrist. Understand how the two witnesses control the environment of the world in the first half of the tribulation period. &lt;i&gt;Simply Revelation&lt;/i&gt; will bring you clarity to Gods coming judgment!" />
