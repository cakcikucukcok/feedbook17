  <title>Dwelling by the Well - Paula Rae Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold, and the LORD blessed him there.&lt;/I&gt; - Genesis 26:12
&lt;P&gt;This is a daily devotional guide for anyone who hungers and thirsts for a rich and exciting walk with Christ. What an incredible verse! Isaac was already wealthy beyond description. His father, Abraham, had given gifts to Issac&#39;s various half-brothers, and had made Isaac, &quot;the Seed of Promise&quot;, his sole heir.
&lt;P&gt;Then as Isaac obeyed and served God, God increased him a hundred-times over in one year! Then, since money isn&#39;t really everything, God blessed him in all other dimensions of life, as well. 
&lt;P&gt;Wow! Was this a one-time deal? Or is God really not a &quot;respecter of persons&quot;? Can anyone dwell in this dazzling Presence who seeks to do so? This devotional book is prayerfully intended to excite us about, and guide us into the unfathomable riches in Christ Jesus!
