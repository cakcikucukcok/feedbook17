  <title>Family Love Miracles - Mary Tuyen, Quang Nguyen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On July 16, 2015, the miracle of the Holy Cross has appeared on the glass doors and windows at our house in Sachse, Texas during a remodeling. Upon a close look at the Cross, the images of Jesus, Virgin Mary and the Saints as well those of evils and Satan were found near the Cross. After many days of prayers to seek Gods Will, the message is all about the Gods Love and Divine Mercy for everyone. Over two thousand years ago, Jesus has made sacrifice of his life on the Holy Cross for the salvation of humanity and gave everyone an eternal life instead of being punished for its committed sin and crime. Once again, through the miracles, He invites everyone to come home to His Divine Mercy and Love and to truly love and be kind to one another as we all are His children. Like a Merciful Father, Pater Misericordes, Jesus is waiting to embrace every person on earth to return to Him soon because his judgment time is near. The Virgin Mary, Lady of Mount Carmel also appeared with her tremendous love for humanity by giving us her scapular as Gods armor for protection from all harms in the difficult time lies ahead. Gods holy people, St. Bridget of Sweden, St. Faustina, St. Gerard Majello, late Cardinal Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan and Martyr Francis Truong Buu Diep also appeared with their prayers for all to be protected from all evils visible and invisible. It is an inspired story of love with the personal touch from God and Virgin Mary for all readers to rediscover Gods Love through this amazing experience and grace blessed by God. May God touch and bless you today with His Love when you see this message!
