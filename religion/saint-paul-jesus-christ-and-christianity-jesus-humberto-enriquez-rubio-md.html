  <title>Saint Paul, Jesus Christ and Christianity - Jesus Humberto Enriquez Rubio Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Catholic religion is a captivating institution which was built on 
the basis of touching, beautiful legends. Since ancient times, it has 
been managed by individuals who dedicate their entire life and 
time to maintaining and spreading this religion, which has become 
deeply rooted in western world family life. Each new family member 
is born, grows and is educated according to Catholic moral and 
dogmas, which thus represents the only natural way to perceive the 
world, both with regard to human and supernatural phenomena. 
Persons raised and educated in this manner are unable to fi nd and 
discover, on their own account, the truth with regard to God. They 
keep the doors of knowledge tightly shut, thus preventing other 
perceptions and possibilities from entering, although their religion 
is merely a beautiful legend that is very far from reality. 
The Catholic Religion has prevailed over the last two millennia 
thanks to the work and testimony represented by the austere 
lifestyle of an army of nuns and priests who, not only are they 
excluded from a payroll, but also engage in collecting funds all 
around the world. These funds continue to increase the wealth 
found in Vatican chests, thus increasing its fi nancial power as well 
as its political and economic infl uence. Such is the source feeding 
the power of the Roman Empire of the west, which is still alive 
and exercising its functions. This is where the church obtains 
such absolute power, infallibility and sanctity, as the Divine Caesar 
it represents. The churchs garments, lavishness, display of power 
as well as the gold exhibited in its quarters, are a representation 
of the Roman Empires power. This is entirely contradictory to the 
humility shown by the Virgin Mary and Joseph, her chaste husband, 
a story which the church itself has spread. You neednt words to 
understand this; you only need to closely appreciate the cover in 
this book" />
