  <title>Come and See - Brendan Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Come and See&lt;/I&gt; is look inside the mind of a  monk. The Vision of monastic life proposed here is not new; it is a  Vision going back to the Desert Fathers of the fourth century. And yet,  it is new because it is rooted in a place in the soul that never grows  old. Come and see where I live, Jesus said to the disciples who were  following him. He could just as well have said, come and see where you  live; where your real life is being lived. Monastic spirituality is not  some esoteric or Gnostic way of perceiving reality or understanding  life. It is a treasure hidden in the field of your own heart; it is a  universal spirituality that is the common inheritance of every human  being; it is a search for God. From the atheist to the saint there is in  the heart of al creatures a desire for ultimate meaning, a desire for  God. In this sense everyone has the heart of a monk.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As you read this book you will meet some of the great themes of  monastic life: silence, solitude, community life, prayer. You will also  be helped to find your most authentic self, the self Thomas Merton  spoke of when he said at the center of our being is a point of  nothingness, a point of pure truth. Nothingness, emptiness, absence are  important aspects of our spiritual journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a  subtheme running through ancient monasticism that conceives of the  monastery as a hospital &#39;a place for healing the soul, the spirit, the  heart. The place of the heart is highlighted in these conferences and  homilies as an ancient theme so relevant to the modern person.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
