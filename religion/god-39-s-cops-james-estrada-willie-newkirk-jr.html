      <meta name="description" content="First lets look at the Hoyle comparison: a typical Boeing 747-400 has about 6 million parts. 
The typical human genome is an organisms complete set of DNA. Genomes vary widely in size: the smallest known genome for a free-living organism (a bacterium) contains about 600,000 DNA base pairs, while human and mouse genomes have some 3 billion. Except for mature red blood cells, all human cells contain a complete genome. DNA in the human genome is arranged into 23 distinct chromosomes--physically separate molecules that range in length from about 50 million to 250 million base pairs (Unknown, 2011).  Lets say despite the fact that people have three billion base pairs that are aligned perfectly and a 747 is only 6 million parts, but for purposes of this discussion lets say that we are only as complex as the 747. OK, here is the problem: first, a 747 was designed, without designers and builders there would be no 747. Remember the analogy I gave of removing the distributor cap from a car and throwing it at the engine and then expecting it to run? 
	You and I have consciousness and we can build a 747. A 747 does not have consciousness and cant build a human. In fact, we are far more sophisticated than a 747 and we cant build a human from the ground up yet. Now detractors would say of course you can build a 747 because you have many more parts that comprise you that make you and you are an intelligent being. All true making me more complex than a 747 and thus more likely to have been designed than the 747, and we all know the 747 was designed. Not just designed by someone in a garage to get us by, engineered to stringent standards taking into account all the forces, stresses and elements it was going to encounter on Earth. Now remember: you are expected to believe that this thing (the 747) that was engineered and is less sophisticated than you are came about by engineering, but you who is realistically at least eight times more complex came about by random chance and mutation. Has anybody ever seen a Cessna randomly mutate into a 747? If we go around randomly killing Cessnas, will they mutate into F-18s so they can get away or fight back? You can argue faster Cessnas might survive more often than slower Cessnas but they are all still Cessnas. However, the faster Cessnas will only survive if they are piloted by people. Further, if we squeeze more and more people into the Cessna that still wont make it a 747.
	The Earth is covered over by 75% water. Why not 30%? Why not 100%? Because of the 
oceans we have are perfect amount of salt to produce the right amount of rainfall, otherwise Earth would either be a desert or a water world. The Earth is covered by salt water over the majority of its surface, water that is undrinkable to humans. Were it not for the formation of vast amounts of freshwater, we would not be here. Why is there any freshwater?  Why isnt it all freshwater? The Earths composition allows for human life to survive in every location upon it naturally with the exception of Antarctica.  Remember one thing from the first time you boiled water: salt water freezes at a lower temperature and boils at a lower temperature. This means salt water evaporates at a lower temperature. If the oceans were all fresh water there would be a lot less water vapor in the air and less rain. In order to have more water vapor in a world with freshwater oceans you would need more of it to be exposed to the sun, which means more of the planet would need to be water. It seems we have just the right balance of salt water and salinity of that salt water to make rain, and just the right balance of freshwater to survive. 
	The Earth might well roll around on its axis but for a single large moon to stabilize its orbit and provide tidal changes. If the oceans had been bigger the tidal effect would have been greater and much of the life that relies on tides would not exist. The Earth has an atmosphere that protects us from radiation and keeps" />
