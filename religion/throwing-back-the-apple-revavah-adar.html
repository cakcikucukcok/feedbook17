  <title>Throwing Back the Apple - Revavah Adar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Throwing Back the Apple&#39;  tells the story of Marian and her love affair with Yair, an Israeli artist:  &quot;Tell me your story&quot; Yair asked. That&#39;s a bit boring I thought to myself-the story of me. But he insisted and...I suppose I could say something quickly-like give a thumb nail sketch. I could start by saying that I&#39;m English, that I was born to a seventeen-year-old unwed mother in mid January during a snowstorm. My first name, Marian, has no particular significance other than my mother liked it. My middle name, Rachel, was given in honor of her favorite teacher who was Jewish. &#39;Throwing Back the Apple&#39; explores, in a very simple down to earth manner, a new horizon for female/male relationship. Revavah doesn&#39;t offer the reader any New-age gimmicks, no special gadgets, one can shop for; just very simple realizations about Yair, herself and human nature. Marian is introduced to the astonishing simplicity of everything, and the ancient Hebrew frequency; that draws its wisdom from Genesis." />
