  <title>Encounter with God: Every Day for a Year - Andrew Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s wise to take a guide...
You wouldn&#39;t plan to climb a high and challenging mountain without taking a skilled guide with you. It&#39;s the same with the Bible. Everyone needs a little help, especially when we&#39;re talking about understanding difficult passages and applying them to contemporary living.
Here is some of the best writing in Encounter with God over the previous years - providing a stimulating, in-depth approach to Bible reading.
Enjoy the exhilaration of gaining new understanding of God&#39;s eternal purposes. This book uses exposition from some of today’s best Bible teachers, including Michael Baughen, Steve Motyer and Jo Bailey Wells. It is also a great introduction to all the main literary genres in the Bible: law, history, psalms, prophecy, apocalyptic, gospel and epistle as it covers key biblical books in a fantastic overview of God’s wonderful plan of salvation. Contains 365 undated readings from previous years&#39; editions of Encounter with God notes, plus a helpful introduction." />
