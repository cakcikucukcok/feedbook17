  <title>Some Things That Please God - Surujnauth Surujpaul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To anyone who is seeking a deeper relationship with God, this book is a must-read.
Some Things That Please God is a compilation of scriptures and comments on different ways to please God.
For example, God is always pleased with faithhaving confidence in God. Today we find people who cannot believe God for spiritual strength to fight Satan. As a result, their lives are far from pleasing God. We must believe God for the fulfillment of his wonderful promises in our lives, and then we will see his abundant blessings.
God is pleased with worship and praise. When we give him praise in humble and sincere worship, he opens the windows of heaven and showers us with all his blessings.
Believers who come together in sweet fellowship can be assured that God is in their midst. He delights in the unity of the Body of Christ and visits them with his sweet presence. Discord and confusion turn his favor against us, so let us strive to be together in one spirit when we worship.
Giving pleases God. He looks down from heaven on the generous givers and rewards them with his bountiful blessings. We cannot deny that his blessings are shared with all those who give cheerfully and from a pure heart.
God is a holy God and, as such, demands holy living from his followers. Contrast holy living with the fruits of the fleshhatred, envy, jealousy, covetousness, adultery, fornication. His favor is against those who live after the flesh. But his grace is extended to those who live holy.
Let us strive to do the things that please God and, as such, receive the favor of God." />
