  <title>From Adam to Abraham - Thomas Lee Mobley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an examination of the first twenty five chapters of The Book Of Genesis from the King James Version of the Holy Scriptures. God, which is a combination of Personalities, One of which is Yahweh, created all things in what is today called the Big Bang.  At that split second, all energy and matter were created. God called it into existence and at that instant, ninety five percent of all matter went into other dimensions, or vibrations. The result is that we humans can only see or touch five percent of universal matter. 
All stars, planets, and living things were created at this second. Only the Angels of God were in existence at the time of the big bang. They were all happy except for one. This angels name was Lucifer. 
One of the things created by The Personalities of God, were a host of spirit beings which would inhabit human bodies at the time of conception. The first human was called Adam by Yahweh, and the second one was called Eve. Between the two of them, they were to begin the process of making children. They were to live forever on Earth in human form. They would not age, not grow sick and die, and Eve would have her children without any pain or effort. They were given two commands. One was to have many children, and the other was to not eat the fruit of a certain tree. We all know this was a test, and to break this command would mean they would die before the billion year day they were living in at the time of the violation was over. 
Lucifer was put in charge of Earth and the humans. He immediately set about to ruin Gods plan.  The result was that Adam and Eve, and all people on earth would die. And they did.
God set in motion a plan to save all mankind by means of person in the future. He told this to Eve, and Lucifer heard it also. 
This is the story of the Messianic Lineage that started with Adam and Eve, and carried forward even after the great worldwide deluge, to a man named Abraham and his wife named Sarah.
All mankind began with a life span where a day equaled a thousand years. The life span changed at the time Noah entered the ark with his family to a day equaling one hundred and twenty years. It was changed again when Abraham and Sarah had a son named Isaac, to our modern life span. Which is less than two hundred years.
This is their story, as I, the author of this book, see it." />
