  <title>Conversations with Mediums - Scott Podmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What happens when we die? Are loved ones still around us after they pass? How do babies represent as souls? What about our petsdo they wait for us on the other side? The world of mediumship has polarized people throughout history, and whether you believe or not, science is starting to take notice and is setting about investigating all possibilities. Bestselling author Scott Podmore returns after a two-year project in which he interviewed more than thirty mediums all over the planet from differing socioeconomic backgrounds and cultures.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this book, he selects twelve of the conversations that took place, and all have a similar line of topics in his aim to find threads of consistencyor inconsistencies. Coming from a standpoint of giving these mediums the benefit of the doubt, he provides a forum to discuss their alleged abilities that cover areas including spirituality, psychic predictions, physical mediumship, electronic voice phenomena, trance, and more.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Podmore delves deep into the world of spiritual mediumship with probing yet respectful questions, in a mission to discover how it all works. He encounters many surprises along the way that may even change your own belief systems, help readers understand their own adversities, find emotional healing, or enrich their lives with new meaning and hope.&lt;/P&gt;" />
