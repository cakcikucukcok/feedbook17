  <title>Enjoying a Happier Life Now! - Angelia K. George-Lundy, Eureka F. Collins, Flora H. Henry, Goldia H. George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspiring, prolific and full of wisdom. These women have provided a timeless volume that is a roadmap to the root causes of happiness and unhappiness. It is a refreshing message.
&lt;p&gt;
- J. P. Norris, Senior Pastor
&lt;p&gt;
This is an excellent read! I learned a lot about myself and how to become truly happy. I think everyone who reads this book will learn and grow, becoming immeasurably happy!
&lt;p&gt;
 A. S. Hunter, Clinical Psychologist
&lt;p&gt;
I really enjoyed this book and have some rethinking to do. I am determined to put real happiness back into my life.
&lt;p&gt;
 P. Minor, PhD., University Professor
&lt;p&gt;
This book covered a lot of information that will be directly relevant to the readers life. I found it to be extremely useful. I will be able to apply all of its concepts and principles into my life and help others to do the same.
&lt;p&gt;
 G. Collins, Author, The Leadership Mind
&lt;p&gt;
This book opened my eyes to how happiness is perceived and what is needed in order to truly enjoy it. Now I have the knowledge and understanding of happiness to live a happier life and to explain its importance to others.
&lt;p&gt;
 G. G. Parker, Counselor
&lt;p&gt;
Co-authors Eureka F. Collins, Goldia George, Flora H. Henry and Angelia K. George-Lundy, have written a personal, well-informed, and highly enjoyable book on enjoying a happier life now. The four women teach that happiness isnt some far-fetched concept that cannot be obtained as they commit the knowledge of their combined 243 years of experience to paper. Though everyone desires to be happier, how many of us are really happy? For answer-seekers, this book will show you how to increase your happiness no matter how happy you may think you were when you start reading.
&lt;p&gt;
As you read this book, you will soon realize that accomplishments, status, material possessions, and relationships dont have inherent value; then, you may desire to rethink your approach to enjoying life and change the way you motivate yourself. Additionally, this book will help you focus on looking at yourself in ways that you may have been afraid to before as well as knowing Gods plan for your life.
