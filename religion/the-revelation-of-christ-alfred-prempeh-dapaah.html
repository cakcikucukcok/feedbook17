  <title>The Revelation of Christ - Alfred Prempeh-Dapaah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The revelation of Christ reveals, brings and talks about Christ and his personal
nature. It talks about how Christ has been in existence, even before the
foundation of the earth as the Son of the living God. How he manifested in the
person of Jesus Christ to reveal the Father to the world. It also throws light on
some of the purposes for which he was sent by the Father, being, to destroy the
works of the devil by the Power of the Holy Ghost, reconcile mankind to God;
and how he has entrusted the same power unto the Body of Christ, the Church.
The church of Jesus Christ needs to rise up, manifest and demonstrate for Christ
to be seen in and through their lives as a witness by the power entrusted to them
through the Holy Ghost.
Revelation of Christ reveals Christ as never before and needs to be read by both
Christians to strengthen their faith and to build intimacy with the Father.
The writing of this book is purely by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and the
living Word of God. All credits go to the heavenly Father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dedications and appreciations&lt;br&gt;
First and foremost to the Almighty God who inspired and has made this project
a success and to the Body of Christ for whom this book is written, my wonderful
wife, Hilde Van Eetvelde and our three children; Leroy, Lewis and Lloyd. To the
brethren in Belgium who have stood together with me in prayer all these years;
Pastors Richmond Quarcoe, Michael Acheampong, Nicholas Amoh, Emmanuel
Otoo, Erik Schobbens and families; God bless you all richly. Let us believe for the
Body of Christ in Belgium to rise up in faith, in love, unity and harmony." />
