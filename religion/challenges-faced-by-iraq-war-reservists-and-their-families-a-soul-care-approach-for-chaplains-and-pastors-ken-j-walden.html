  <title>Challenges Faced by Iraq War Reservists and Their Families: A Soul Care Approach for Chaplains and Pastors - Ken J. Walden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Iraq War caused emotional, physical, psychiatric, relational, and spiritual challenges to an untold number of military reservists and their families. This book takes you through the war&#39;s critical stages of pre-deployment, deployment, and post-deployment. Reservists&#39; families, usually living far from military bases with professional staffing, are often among the most affected wounded of the Iraq War. Injured reservists often return home to discover that civilian medical resources are insufficient and civic organizations unequipped to help manage the range of combat-related wounds and psychiatric trauma, especially post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. The lack of needed services causes alienation between reservists and their families in relation to the civilian communities in which they live. Using a practical theological method, this book analyzes the various impacts of the Iraq War and recommends a soul care approach for chaplains and pastors to use in support of reservists and their families suffering from their experiences of the Iraq War, and to guide any persons interested in participating in such support." />
