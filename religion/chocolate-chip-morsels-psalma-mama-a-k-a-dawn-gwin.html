  <title>Chocolate Chip Morsels - Psalma Mama a.k.a. Dawn Gwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I can think about a homemade apple pie baking in the oven with its fresh sliced apples, cinnamon, and nutmeg, the melted butter and filling drizzling over the sides. I can almost smell it, even taste it. Can you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the story Chocolate Chip Morsels, when one person gives what they have to someone who doesnt deserve it, what can we expect? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know when to listen to your heart and when to listen to others? In Gift for Mama we learn this very valuable lesson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times you should ask for help. At other times you need to step up and Butter Your Own Corn. Each chocolate chip morsel found in this book will portray character-building insight for the child in you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something we can all relate to. One can envision a parent or grandparent surrounded by their children discussing these life lessons to be embraced.  Lorraine Reiber, Financial Administrator for Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron, Utah &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an uplifting, encouraging book. As a family, we all get something from each storyand a little laugh too.  Jonathon Otts, Engineering Specialist, Alabama &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fast-paced world we live in, these stories are timely in my own life and valuable in teaching good morals for all ages. Great stories to share around a campfire or a kitchen table.  Henry Florczak, Farmer of East Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my walk with the Lord, there are times when I need to be reminded of the goodness of God. Dawn Gwin is one who explains the way through her stories.  F.H. Dewey; Retired Railroad Engineer, Anchorage, Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspirational and wise stories. They are a great reminder to be kind and selfless. It also made me think about what Im leaving behind for others.  Ashley Wolsey, age 13, a young reader&lt;/p&gt;" />
