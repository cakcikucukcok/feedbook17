  <title>The Power of Healing with Intuition and Positive Thinking - Valeri Glover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each and every one of us has the ability to tap into the universe and use our intuitive gifts to heal the body, mind, and Spirit. When we use our gifts, it is a powerful thing that can help heal ourselves as well as others and mankind as a whole. Throughout the years, I found that if I use the following principles and techniques I am able to relax my body, calm my mind, and sooth my spirit. 
I feel more at peace and connected when I:
	Connect with My Intuitive Self
	Ground, Center, and Protect Myself
	Connect with My Spirit Guides, Guardian Angels, Archangel, and the Universe
	Work with My Chakras to Heal
	Clear Chakras, Auras, Energy Fields, Blockages, and Cut Cords
	Use Intuitive Readings, Energy Healings, Oracle and Angel Card Readings to Guide Me
	Use Positive Thinking to Help Get Me Through Lifes Challenges and Illness (Like Cancer)
	Cut the Cords of Fear and Doubt
	Use Manifesting to Achieve My Dreams and Life Purpose
	Use Affirmations and Meditation for Positive Thinking, Wellbeing and Health Issues
When you use the principles and techniques in this book, you will have a better outlook on life to where you can bring positive energy to help heal your body, mind, and spirit." />
