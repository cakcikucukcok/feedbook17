  <title>Epistles on Clergy Abuse - Vincent J. Nauheimer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; What makes &lt;U&gt;Epistles on Clergy Abuse &lt;/U&gt; unique? It is written from a very personal perspective; it is a living chronological history of the clergy abuse scandal in letter form; it contains numerous no-holds barred letters sent to the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church in America over a nine year period; the letters hoist the hierarchy on their own petard using quotes from Scripture, Canon Law and the Catechism. This book offers proof that the hierarchy has and continues to bamboozle the public with their shallow cries of protecting innocent priests when, according to all that is holy, they knew they had both the means and the power to punish sexually abusive priests at their disposal. &lt;U&gt; Epistles on Clergy Abuse &lt;/U&gt; also holds the hierarchy accountable for failing to cleanse their own ranks for bringing grave scandal upon the church. &lt;/P&gt;
 &lt;P&gt;In addition to the letters to the hierarchy are the letters to survivors. At times angry, passionate, heart-wrenching and sometimes humorous, these letters give the reader a unique insight into the world of the online clergy sexual abuse support groups. Nothing like this has been written before and it is not likely that correspondence sent over the course of several years regarding such a horrific subject will ever be put together again. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; This is the book the hierarchy does not want read. It exposes them for the frauds they are, the folly that holds their sway and the wretched effects of their damnable failure to protect the children of Catholic families across the country. Nauheimer knows first hand how his writings have enabled others to come forward and find their voices. He hopes that by reading &lt;U&gt; Epistles on Clergy Abuse, &lt;/U&gt; the general public and the Catholic laity will seek the removal of those in the hierarchy hell bent on protecting priests who would and have raped, sodomized and molested children. The hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church by their omissions and commissions have perpetuated an unspeakable evil and it has to stop. &lt;/P&gt;" />
