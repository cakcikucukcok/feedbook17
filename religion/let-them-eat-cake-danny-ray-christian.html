  <title>Let Them Eat Cake - Danny Ray Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For my sixth book, I have drawn on the wealth of wisdom from some of the worlds most successful and enlightened people. Additionally I have dug into my own store of knowledge about life to bring to you what it has taught me about being a person of purpose and conscience. I promise you that you are sure to get both knowledge and inspiration that you can use for each day as you read the daily quotes and meditations written in this book. Basically what I want you to do as you read it is to get a picture of life being your own slice of cake for you to enjoy at your leisure. Be certain that what you will get out of this book are answers as to how to both live life on its own terms as well as come to terms with your own greatness and struggles. I would like to say that I am pleased with how God helped me in the writing of each page of this book in such a way that even I was surprised at some of the things I realized as I did commentaries on the various quotes introducing each meditation. Lastly, I wrote this book as a legacy to my children and future generations. It is the bread crumbs I hope to leave them to help them find their way through the complex maze of life. Without which they may end up lost in one of its blind allies like I did for many years. So I welcome you to my world and table for a slice of cake and some pertinent pointers on life. 
You can contact me for workshops and my testimony at dannycrystal7963@gmail.com. 
I wish to give a special thanks to all the staff and clients of HRDI who have supported me since 2013. I am especially appreciative of my cousins Doris and Sheri and my friends Tonya, Gwyn, Rosetta, Nneka, and Billy." />
