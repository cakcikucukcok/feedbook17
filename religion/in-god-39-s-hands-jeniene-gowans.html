  <title>In God&#39;s Hands - Jeniene Gowans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you think you are the only one wondering if God is there when you are going through your trials and your testing, think again. When we are faced with challenges, we all ask ourselves the same&amp;nbsp;question, &amp;ldquo;where is God in all of this?&amp;rdquo; It is when you notice that there are just one set of footprints&amp;nbsp;in the sand that aren&amp;rsquo;t yours, after surviving the worst of situations, then you come to realize, that&amp;nbsp;God was always with you.&amp;nbsp;In God&amp;rsquo;s Hands is a daily account of personal encounters with God and oppositions from Satan. It&amp;nbsp;offers insight on the spiritual encounters that a close relationship with God can have on an&amp;nbsp;individual. It gives reassurance of God&amp;#39;s faithfulness to those who are His, and highlights the&amp;nbsp;manifestation of His awesome power in the believer&amp;#39;s life when faced with difficult situations&amp;nbsp;where it seems humanly impossible to overcome. It also sheds light on some of the wiles of the&amp;nbsp;enemy and how God equips and prepares His children to overcome the opposer by trusting and&amp;nbsp;using the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
