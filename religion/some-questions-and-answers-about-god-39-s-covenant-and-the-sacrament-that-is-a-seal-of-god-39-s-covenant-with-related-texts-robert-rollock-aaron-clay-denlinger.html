  <title>Some Questions and Answers about God&#39;s Covenant and the Sacrament That Is a Seal of God&#39;s Covenant: With Related Texts - Robert Rollock, Aaron Clay Denlinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert Rollock is best remembered today for the role he played in the development of Reformed covenant theology, a role defined especially by the uniquely mature treatment of a pre-fall covenant of works discovered in his thought. However, scholarship on Rollock&#39;s covenant thought has until now been based almost entirely on an early modern English translation of Rollock&#39;s Tractatus de vocatione efficaci (1597), and has overlooked discussion of the covenant of works found both in Rollock&#39;s 1596 Quaestiones et responsiones aliquot de Foedere Dei, deque Sacramento quod foederis Dei sigillum est and his 1593 Romans commentary. This volume offers the first complete English translation of Rollock&#39;s 1596 catechism as well as English translations of relevant sections from his Romans commentary that deal with the subject of God&#39;s covenants with man. Thus this volume stands to offer students of Reformed covenant theology a better understanding of Rollock&#39;s thought and the contribution he made to the evolution of Reformed theology, particularly on the matter of God&#39;s covenant with humankind before the fall." />
