  <title>I Took the Sex Gods to Thailand - Lee Huxley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the true story of a self-confessed sexual zealot
who, while satisfying his lust with bar girls in Hong
Kong, Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand, is compelled by
the intensity of his libido to find its deeper meaning through
Tantra. Tantra teaches that the fast track to enlightenment
and to God, is not celibacy as Buddha and Jesus taught, but
Maithuna or sacred sex. In Tantra, Go-Go dancers and escorts
are avatars of the goddess Shakti and can be used as spiritual
rocket fuel.
His love of women eventually persuades him to marry a Thai
girl that creates an impossible dilemma in his life. He is torn
between his love for one woman and his insatiable need for
Go-Go dancers, who in Thailand are beautiful, affordable,
and abundant.
He fears his sex utopia in Thailand is threatened by the Islamic
insurgency in the south. Beneath the face of tourist paradise,
Thailand is afflicted with divisive political and religious unrest.
Thailand is waiting for the new Buddha to return to establish
a golden age of peace. But Buddha is not coming back and only
the sex gods of Tantra can save Thailand. Only the sex gods
can save the world." />
