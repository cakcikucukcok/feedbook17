  <title>Am I There Yet? - Sherry S. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why am I holding this book in my hand? I dont have time for this!&lt;br /&gt;
God has a plan for you. He wants a relationship with you, and your soul is reaching out to Him. But finding time in your busy schedule to add another commitment is difficult. Do not hesitate; begin right now. Not next Monday or next week or the beginning of next year. Take action now.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The message within this book is a guide to help you recognize Gods presence in your daily life. God speaks through His creation and the people we meet every day. Do you hear His voice? &lt;br /&gt;
As with any new venture, the beginning steps are always the hardest. This study is simply ninety days! Even ninety days may seem too much when you barely have time to complete all of todays tasks. Do not concern yourself with the ninetieth day; simply plan for today! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. To give you a future and a hope.&lt;br /&gt;
Jeremiah 29:11&lt;/p&gt;" />
