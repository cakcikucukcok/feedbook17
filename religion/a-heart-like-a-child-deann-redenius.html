  <title>A Heart Like a Child - DeAnn Redenius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After December 25, 2007, the Redenius family would never be the same again. Just days before, DeAnn had proclaimed to her husband the frustration she felt about the true meaning of Christmas, which was the birth of Christ. This message seemed to have diminished in importance everywhere she looked, whether it was in a store, an advertisement, or in the songs played on a radio station, Jesus seemed to be taken out of Christmas.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;DeAnn reminded herself what Christmas was really aboutwho Jesus really was and why He came to save mankind in the first place. As she made a promise that night to God that she would make sure everyone knew who Jesus was, DeAnn never thought that she would be called out to deliver His message so soon! It was the phone call they received the night of Christmas that would change the lives of the family forever.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;DeAnn was later instructed to give her testimony of Jesus Christ in a time of tragedy when her family learned what it truly meant to accept Christs unfailing love and salvation with an indescribable heart of what it truly means to forgive and love one another. Jesus called all to have that Heart like a Child.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is where DeAnns story begins and endswith the message of believing even when Gods ways cannot be seen or understood. In the midst their trials and sufferings, DeAnn and her family chose to look to God and take refuge, for there was hope for a new day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
