  <title>The Groom&#39;s Arrival - John Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Groom&#39;s Arrival&lt;/i&gt; will guide you into the traditions and the Scriptures that form new insights into God&#39;s love story for mankind.  It contains details from the Hebrew wedding tradition. The mysteries of this ancient tradition will enhance your understanding of the bride, the Church, and God&#39;s ultimate plan.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The author uses the wedding tradition forms a framework to bring together scriptures from Jesus&#39; Olivet Discourse, the Days of Daniel, the Scroll of Revelation, and the End Times.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you read about the ten elements of the wedding tradition, you will begin to see the beauty and purpose behind our finding a relationship with God in a new and exciting way. Gods greatest desire for us is to be in relationship with Him.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Carpenter of Galilee has been working on the wedding chamber, or chuppah, for His bride for nearly two thousand years. Remember He said, &quot;I go to prepare a place for you...&quot;  In this book you are given a glimpse of what it will be like.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In the final chapters of the book of Revelation, the Marriage Supper of the Lamb is a headline event.  Many love stories end with and they lived happily ever after. This marriage supper is just a starting point for much more. The Bible gives more insight into Jesus millennial reign than you might imagine. In The Grooms Arrival, you will discover many wonderful things about God&#39;s plan.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, 
Nor have entered into the heart of man 
The things which God has prepared for those who love Him. (1 Corinthians 2:9)&lt;/p&gt;" />
