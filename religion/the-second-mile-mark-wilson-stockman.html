  <title>The Second Mile - Mark Wilson Stockman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is dedicated to those who feel they have gone beyond the limits of Gods love and forgiveness, and is written for believers and unbelievers alike. There are those who think they have done things so terrible that God could not possibly love them. I know this is true because I was one of them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I used to feel that God had given up on me, but theres a problem with feelings like that. Not only do they hinder you from coming to Him, but they can obscure the truth of what God has declared in His Word. It is my profound prayer that as you study how God has demonstrated His love for us, you can put your fears and misconceptions aside.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As is true in every area of life, a true understanding of Gods Word will set the captive free!&lt;/p&gt;" />
