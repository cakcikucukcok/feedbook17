  <title>The Hidden Hand of God - Theresa Dozier-Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a place in Him where we can be in touch with Him, where no talking is necessary. This is like when a young couple first falls in love, they just want to be in each others presence; they can sit in each others company for hours. They are communicating on an intimate level where words are not necessary. I have seen couples adjust their schedules just to be with each other. They will stay up late, even if they have to get up early for work the next day; they will hang on the to the phone for hours just to hear the others breath. They are chatting with their hearts to each otherheart to heart, breast to breastconversing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most of us do not know Him with this level of intimacy, and the sad part is that we do not know Him. It is possible to know a great deal about God without much knowledge of Him. We often find ourselves having a deep interest in religion, and this is all well, but the ability to be able to think clearly and talk well about Christian subjects is not the same as knowing Him
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One must know the heartbeat and pulse of God in order to stay closely connected with Him." />
