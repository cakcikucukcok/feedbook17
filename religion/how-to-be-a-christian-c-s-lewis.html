Lewis has long influenced our perceptions and understanding of the faith. More than fifty years after his death, Lewis&amp;#8217;s arguments remain extraordinarily persuasive because they originate from his deep insights into the Christian life itself. Only an intellectual of such profound faith could form such cogent and compelling reasons for its truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Be a Christian&lt;/em&gt; brings together the best of Lewis&amp;#8217;s insights on Christian practice and its expression in our daily lives. Cultivated from his many essays, articles, and letters, as well as his classic works, this illuminating and thought-provoking collection provides practical wisdom and direction Christians can use to nurture their faith and become more devout disciples of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By provoking readers to more carefully ponder their faith, &lt;em&gt;How to Be a Christian&lt;/em&gt; can help readers forge a deeper understanding of their personal beliefs and what is means to be a Christian, and strengthen their profound relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
