  <title>A Call to Witness - Clarence G. Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In life, we can take many journeys, but nothing is like a spiritual journey of a lifetime.  I was fortunate to have an opportunity to go on a pilgrimage to Israel with other ministers.  We were selected as a group to go on a special trip, a trip that perhaps would impact each of us in a very unique way.  We went on the journey to learn, to observe and to be strengthened in our faith.  While we were there, we reflected on our ministry and spent time discerning our call and our future.  We toured biblical sites that focused on the Jews, the Romans, the Arabs, and particularly on the ministry of Jesus Christ.  We traveled several places like Tiberias of Galilee, Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem, and many other sites.  
During my time in Israel, I had some interesting moments on the pilgrimage.  There were moments at certain sites I felt deeply touched and spiritual uplifted as I walked and looked around.    My faith was strengthened as I rode the boat on the Sea of Galilee.  I felt spiritually uplifted when I was in Caesarea Philippi.  And, I felt touched the most when I was at the Garden Tomb where Jesus was buried.    I must say there is something about visiting Israel that will touch your heart.  My heart was touched many times and I left with an everlasting impression.  If you want to experience or explore the biblical sites and learn about the ministry of Jesus Christ, I encourage you to visit and be inspired and feel the joy in the Holy Land." />
