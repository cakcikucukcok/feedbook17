  <title>God and Freedom - Jon Rod Christie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have a plan to one Christmas ride a Midnight Express to Salt Lake City. We are Christians, not Mormons, but we will spend a few days where thousands meet in His name and hear His music. We will attend Christmas by the Tabernacle Choir. Life is like a train station where two tracks run in opposite directions. One train runs uphill to where Christ dwells. Another train runs downhill to where he is ignored. Folks who board the downhill train are fully aware of the uphill train, but insist that theirs is the proper train. As the land they travel into turns dark and chaotic, they imagine that error is truth, that bitter is sweet, and that despair is the norm. As the uphill train travels its passengers see a new land where clear waters run deep, where the sun is bright and warm, where people come and go as they please, and where there is singing and joy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God and Freedom, What matters in Life, by Jon Christie is a powerful book about life and how to live it. It is a profound analysis of many facets of life and a guide to truth. I will use it as a reference. The discussion of science to demonstrate the need of a Creator interpretation was accurate and clear, and helpful to the layman. I recommend that everyone read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
