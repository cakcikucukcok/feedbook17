  <title>Beyond Genesis: Man&#39;s True Origin Revealed - Allen Epling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beyond Genesis: Man’s True Origin Revealed, takes the book of Genesis and re-interprets what it is saying, but from a modern science-based perspective. This book gives a reasonable explanation that ties all the “mysteries” of Genesis into one very interesting story line. The hypothesis presented to the reader reads like a novel from the Garden of Eden to the Tower of Babel.
The basis of the book is that the scientific Big Bang is correct but that there were two creations and the Garden of Eden was a second, more recent event that set in motion a plan to lift Homo Sapiens to our present technological level. It was all part of a blueprint for mankind that was begun in the Garden and completed with the dispersion at the Tower of Babel." />
