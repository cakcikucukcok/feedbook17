  <title>Sermons of a Psychiatrist - Charles Fulghum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book puts psychiatrist/priest Fulghum solidly in the company of Soren Kierkegaard, Irvin Yalom, and (I would add) Ernest Becker: existential realists with indomitable faith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus issued two orders to those he called. The first was Come! The second was, Go!This little book does what Jesus did, again and again. Fulghums candid humanity beckons us to come, to recognize ourselves both more deeply and (briefly) more comfortably. And he sends us out  relentlessly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is risky. Deep insight is not only a personal pleasureit rapidly emerges as responsibility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Rev. Canon Gray Temple&lt;br /&gt;
Retired Rector, St. Patricks Episcopal Church, Atlanta.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charles has put together an anthology of his sermons that promises to deliver perhaps one of the most unique perspectives in Episcopal preaching. Having listened in the pews to many of Charles sermons I can promise that the reader will not only be entertained but will discover God found living betwixt and between moral psychiatry, existentialism and medical science. In the best of the Episcopal tradition Charles makes us think about God in relevant and thought provoking ways by reminding us that our stories are part of of a much bigger narrative.&lt;br /&gt;
