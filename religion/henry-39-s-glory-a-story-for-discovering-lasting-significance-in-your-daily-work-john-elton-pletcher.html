  <title>Henry&#39;s Glory: A Story for Discovering Lasting Significance in Your Daily Work - John Elton Pletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever wonder if your daily work really matters? Do you wish your career could truly connect with Christ&#39;s mission and the bigger story he&#39;s writing every day? Is it possible for you to find deeper satisfaction in your job, greater integration of your faith in your daily work, and stronger connections with co-workers, clients, and other work contacts?  In Henry&#39;s Glory, Zach and Maggie face a critical crisis in both family and their careers. Old spiritual ghosts haunt Zach&#39;s psyche, based on his larger-than-life uncle&#39;s narrow view of the kind of work that truly glorifies God. Transported across their journey of discovery by a classic old pickup truck and several wise but oh-so-quirky characters, Zach and Mags embark on an intriguing quest for a real sense of calling and greater life purpose in their everyday work. Their story of discovery proves stunning, provocative, and forever perspective-changing.  Join the adventure of personal discovery in this captivating story. Henry&#39;s Glory supplies a robust blend of humor, biblical/spiritual inspiration, history, romance, mystery, and thought-provoking reflection questions for personal study and group discussion." />
