  <title>The Ethical Standard - Paul Arthur Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE ETHICAL STANDARD
The anthology of ethics reveals truths seldom if ever investigated, such as how Sarah the mother of Isaac and wife of Abraham felt about having him attempt in her eyes to murder her son. When we feel something is right in our eyes, we often act on it, but are we aware of whether it is emotionally honest, for dishonest feelings in relationships often betray us into doing things that are morally incorrect. Ethics is the study of what is morally correct, but ethicists have not taken into account whether our feelings, that motivate us and shape the reality we see with are morally honest. Until we know whether our feelings are honest, we will never be able to fulfill the moral command that is the entire summation of good books, to love your neighbor, as yourself is love of God.
When we love our neighbor, we love God, yet up until the latest century with the advent of the psychology of self-love, we were taught to deny ourselves making it impossible to fulfill the moral command, in effect as we denied ourselves, we denied God. The Ethical Standard investigates the damage done to our social system because of this and reveals an entertaining look at the science of inter-dimensional travel and the advent of ideas that reveal we are just beginning an eternal road of purposeful happiness." />
