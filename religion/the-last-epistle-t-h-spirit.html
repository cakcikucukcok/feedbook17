  <title>The Last Epistle - T. H. Spirit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Last Epistle is written with the scriptures and exposes mysteries of the Bible never before revealed, ultimately shining light on prophecy.  Christ said he is the beginning [Alpha] and the end [Omega] all of which has been explained in this little book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we headed for WW III?  Why is there so much of an uproar in the Middle East? When God is good why is there so much bad in this world?  Why did God create mankind?  Was it for his pleasure as some claim?  Yet there is so much suffering in the world, surly God does not get pleasure from this, does he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Proverbs nine, verse ten Solomon tells us the beginning of wisdom is to fear the Lord.  Hence where are the wise?  Where is the scribe?  Where are the prophets?&lt;/p&gt;" />
