  <title>Semi Serious - Charlotte Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Semi Serious invites you along for the ride as the author recounts the sudden change in direction that her life took, from teaching middle school to getting behind the wheel of an eighteen-wheeler. She opens up about the initial decision, training, and challenging rookie year in the first few chapters and incorporates Bible verses and some of her personal poems throughout. After gaining experience and a certain level of comfort, more attention could be paid to the freedom and adventure of the open road, the sights of nature, and encounters with people she would otherwise never have met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pages keep turning, the journey evolves from highway miles to a spiritual journey that may surprise you as much as it did the author. While not included in the list of employee benefits, the solitude and vast time for reflection and connection with God prove to be one of the best perks of trucking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi Serious seems like a unique experience, but perhaps not. Setting aside the specifics, the courage to Step out in faith has guided countless people to act on Gods inspiration and find priceless rewards. Semi Serious is for those at every stage of their own spiritual journey, since there are as many different roads to faith as there are people in this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi Serious is one womans journey of stepping outside of the box while climbing into the cab of a big rig and always holding the hand of God. Thought provoking and insightful, this compilation of stories and poems is for anyone contemplating a new route in their faith journey. With humor and an attention to detail, Char Stone candidly shares Gods guidance in her life as she travels, literally, the highways of life!&lt;br /&gt;Jean S. Graff, MS, NCC, LCPC&lt;/p&gt;" />
