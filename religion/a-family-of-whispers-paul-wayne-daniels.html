If you bypass this book or purchase it and not read it, you will have missed the opportunity of a lifetime. This opportunity may never come your way again so take this book seriously. 
If you do make the right decision, purchase this book, and read it, you will be doing a life-changing thing, and you will never regret your decision because you have chosen the truth. 
If you are a devout christian, you may think this book isnt for you. It is not only for you, but also for all of humanity. 
Not all of humanity will accept the contents of this book. The ones that do accept it shall receive their reward; the others, not so much. 
One of the writers of this book is in spirit form, and the other is Paul Wayne Daniels. You can complain about this book, but you wont be able to complain about it to Paul because he will be deceased before the book is mass-produced." />
