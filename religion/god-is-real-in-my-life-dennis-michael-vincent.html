  <title>God Is Real in My Life - Dennis Michael Vincent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Sundays of author Dennis Michael Vincents youth were not spent in a church building; he admits to attending church only about a dozen times during his childhood. Instead of knowing God, Vincent ran from him. And, then, at age eighteen, God chased Vincent down and saved him.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In God is Real in My Life, he shares the story of his life and offers a testimony to the difference God has made in his life. With both stories from his past and poetic asides, Vincent provides a host of examples of how God has guided him and others down the right path. From small miracles to large, as well as an array of incidents of divine intervention, Vincent tells about the importance of faith, belief, and being saved.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Is Real in My Life narrates an inspired autobiography of a man who has dedicated his life to the Lord and trusts in Gods power to lead him through lifes adversities and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
