  <title>Enjoying the Presence of the Lord Every Day - Ernest J. Murat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enjoying the Presence of the Lord Every Day draws refreshing water from the wellspring of Gods grace and pours it out so that everyone who desires may find the gifts of the Spirit for living in the Lords presence. The author, Ernest J. Murat, tapping into his service to the Lord as a pastor and missionary, has crafted a guide for all who desire to enjoy dwelling with God each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains the nature of the Lords presence, describes walking with Him, outlines how to enter Gods presence, unveils His glory, reveals the ways to offer worship, calls for followers to announce Gods coming, and reminds His followers of the promised gifts of glory and agape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find a longing to grow closer to God tugging at your heart and soul, then Enjoying the Presence of the Lord Every Day will offer you the guidance you need to come into His presence daily, to grow in your faith, and to manifest Gods glory in your daily life. When you do, others will notice a change in you and, perhaps, be attracted into seeking ways that they may enjoy the daily presence of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
