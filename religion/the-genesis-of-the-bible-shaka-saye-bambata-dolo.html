  <title>The Genesis of the Bible - Shaka Saye Bambata Dolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and how the Arabs and
Europeans took these Afrikan Religious Belief Systems from ancient Egypt,
North Afrika and used them during The Trans-Sahara Afrikan Slave Trade
by the Arabs in the name of Allah, and followed by The Transatlantic Afrikan Slave
Trade by the Europeans in the name of Jesus, to enslave the bodies, minds, and souls
of the Afrikan Race. This book is about the Jesus Deception that has been passed
on down through history by European historians, that is still being taught around
the world today. This book takes a provocative intellectual, scholastic, historical,
cultural, and sociological look at the Bible. This book identifies the names of the
translators of the King James Bible of 1611 A. D., and when the chapters and verses
in the Bible were created and who created them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to expose the historical, cultural, sociological, religious
and theological lies of the Europeans and the Arabs. This book reveals the truth of
the origination of The Bible, as There Is No Religion Higher Than The Truth.
Join me in an intellectual odyssey through time. Here, I feel like a Lone Warrior
standing before a mighty army. Come with me on this perilous pilgrimage as we
travel through a parallel universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dedicate this book to my mother and father who gave me life. To the rest of my
Native Afrikan family for supporting me and encouraging me on this publishing
venture. To the Heavenly Father, without whom none of this would be possible.
There are others I would also like to thank for being a part of helping me through
this journey called Life, such as my professors at the Alabama State University where
many a great scholars paths I have crossed. To my American family and friends
in Mobile, Alabama who nurtured and taught me from childhood to adulthood.
The many friends and colleagues I met in my travels all across America in my
intellectual journey, and last but certainly not least, to my publisher for granting
me the opportunity to speak to many all around the world in this forum. I am
eternally indebted to you all-Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
