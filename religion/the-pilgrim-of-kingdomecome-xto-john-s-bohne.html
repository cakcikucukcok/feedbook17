  <title>The Pilgrim of Kingdomecome Xto - John S. Bohne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All of the author&#39;s books are determined to be the world&#39;s most unusual ever written. Satori is searched for in them. Proof is between the covers of each book. This is the fifth book, and perhaps the most revealing in insights and concepts. The writer is a newspaper man turned inspired novelist. It is his habit to be accurate. Today the daily news indicates the growing darkness on the earth plane, and most are starting to see it is as never before in history. All the signs are in of a final ending time. This book defines the darkness, and the way to defeat it in daily lives while yet possible. It is not a preaching book, but a teaching one that reveals solid spiritual fact. Most men are living by fables while they get fat at the tables. Far too many books are of rash assumptions coming out of the darkness due to deceptions. Wily wickedness prevails." />
