  <title>Interior Castle, The - Saint Theresa of 횤vila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Interior Castle was written by St. Teresa of Avila, O.C.D., the Spanish Discalced Carmelite nun and famed mystic, in 1577 as a guide for spiritual development through service and prayer. Inspired by her vision of the soul as a diamond in the shape of a castle containing seven mansions, which she interpreted as the journey of faith through seven stages, ending with union with God. The Interior Castle acts as a practical blueprint for seekers who want to really experience prayer as mystical union with God. Further, Teresa&#39;s exposure of how she was blessed with contemplation illuminates the Catholic theologies of grace, the sacraments, humility, and ultimately love. Translated by the Benedictines of Stanbrook. Revised, with notes and an introduction by Fr. Benedict Zimmerman." />
