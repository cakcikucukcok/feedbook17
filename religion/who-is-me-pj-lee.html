  <title>Who Is Me? - Pj Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Patterns can mean more than you think  even when you dont realize they exist.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Patricia Jane Lee has embraced that truth as a result of examining her past lives, which have spanned the globe.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In her current life, she has enjoyed nursing sick animals  especially the paralyzed ones  while in the past life, she was a paralyzed man.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When Lees family farm was sold, she was devastated, and she carried that pain for years. Later she discovered a past life where she had been an Indian chief whose land was stolen. She then realized she  had been carrying both her own pain and that of the Indian.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In examining her current life and former lives, Lee has discovered remarkable similarities that exist between her past and present. She realizes the person she is today is the sum of all the people she was in her previous lifetimes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Join the author on her healing journey, as she examines the patterns that have permeated her many lives, and, along with love and forgiveness, frees herself from painful remnants of the past.&lt;/P&gt;" />
