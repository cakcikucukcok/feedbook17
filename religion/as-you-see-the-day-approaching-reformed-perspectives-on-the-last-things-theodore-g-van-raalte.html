  <title>As You See the Day Approaching: Reformed Perspectives on the Last Things - Theodore G. Van Raalte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We are in the last days. Living well in such a time depends upon believing that Christ has conquered sin and death and is ruling today, alive at God&#39;s right hand. These essays on the end time will help Christians live like people who really have eternal life already--the life of the Spirit of Christ who lives and moves in both Christ and Christians. Whether your question is about heaven, the soul, hell, the new earth, about how believers in the Old Testament thought of these things, or about what redemptive progress God brought by the resurrection of Christ, you will find answers here. Readers will also be warmly encouraged by the practical and realistic chapters about the Christian&#39;s calling in social and political matters and about the ways that the church&#39;s worship is a participation in heavenly realities. Central to everything about the end time is the fact that by dying and rising, Jesus Christ brought the whole world forward into the last days and has in principle brought Christians into a fullness that Moses and even Adam did not yet know. Read, and be encouraged!" />
