  <title>Renewing Your Mind Through Biblical Principles - Brenda McGibboney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You promised the girls that tonight you would go with them to see that new movie. You are dressed and about to leave the house when your significant others comes through the door.  He takes one glaring look and begins to assault you. With your mouth busted and bleeding he growls, now you can go out!
Lets face it most of us have encountered a domestic violent/abusive situation at least once or twice in our lives.   The problem with Domestic violence or abuse of any kind is that the underlying force is spiritual in nature, and it must be fought with spiritual weapons. But that seems incredible. How can you fight an attitude thats so pervasive?
  What seems incredible or impossible for you, is very credible and possible for God to do in you, and through you.    
Did you ever think that your life of abuse, the things that you encountered would some day help others to overcome their abuse?  Did you think that God would use your life no matter how tattered, ripped, and torn to help mend others?  He can if you would allow Him.   
The story of your life: the abuse, mistreatment, injury, and insults you have encountered are likewise the story of Gods love for you.   God the Son withstood the most gruesome abuse, and ultimate death by man, His own creation, to redeem you back to the Father; thats real love.  Therefore, this recovery plan is to help you to be renewed in your mind, body and spirit so you can help yourself and others to be delivered from domestic violence.   
Renewing Your Mind through Biblical Principles is Gods recovery plan for you.  And it will work, if you work the plan He has given_ His Word." />
