  <title>What Is the Bible? - Rob Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Bell, the beloved author of &lt;em&gt;Love Wins&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;What We Talk About When We Talk About God,&lt;/em&gt; goes deep into the Bible to show how it is more revelatory, revolutionary, and relevant than we ever imagined&amp;#8212;and offers a cogent argument for why we need to look at it in a fresh, new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Love Wins,&lt;/em&gt; Rob Bell confronted the troubling questions that many people of faith were afraid to ask about heaven, hell, fate, and faith. Using the same inspired, inquisitive approach, he now turns to our most sacred book, the Bible. &lt;em&gt;What Is the Bible?&lt;/em&gt; provides insights and answers that make clear why the Bible is so revered and what makes it truly inspiring and essential to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob takes us deep into actual passages to reveal the humanity behind the Scriptures. You cannot get to the holy without going through the human, Rob tells us. When considering a passage, we shouldn&amp;#8217;t ask &quot;Why did God say . . .?&quot; To get to the heart of the Bible&amp;#8217;s meaning, we should be asking: &quot;What&amp;#8217;s the story that&amp;#8217;s unfolding here and why did people find it important to tell it? What was it that moved them to record these words? What was happening in the world at that time? What does this passage/story/poem/verse/book tell us about how people understood who they were and who God was at that time?&quot; In asking these questions, Rob goes beyond the one-dimensional question of &quot;is it true?&quot; to reveal the Bible&amp;#8217;s authentic transformative power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob addresses the concerns of all those who see the Bible as God&amp;#8217;s Word but are troubled by the ethical dilemmas, errors, and inconsistencies in Scripture. With&lt;em&gt; What Is the Bible?,&lt;/em&gt; he recaptures the Good Book&amp;#8217;s magic and reaffirms its power and inspiration to shape and inspire our lives today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
