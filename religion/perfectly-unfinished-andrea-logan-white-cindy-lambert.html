  <title>Perfectly Unfinished - Andrea Logan White, Cindy Lambert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Andrea Logan White appeared to be living the &amp;ldquo;American dream&amp;rdquo; or what many would call a &amp;ldquo;perfect life.&amp;rdquo; However, underneath the happy veneer of the model, actress, and producer, was a subtle, caustic voice leading to emptiness and self-destruction. She was being crushed under the weight of her own drive for &amp;ldquo;perfection.&amp;rdquo; Andrea&amp;rsquo;s remarkable (and often tabloid-worthy) journey that took her from hanging out in the Playboy mansion to finding God at a stop light on Hollywood Boulevard is a page-turner, but it is not the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even discovering Jesus, finding an amazing husband, having beautiful children, and embarking on an exciting career didn&amp;rsquo;t hold the &amp;ldquo;happily ever after&amp;rdquo; Hollywood ending Andrea had envisioned. No matter how successful, how spiritual, how loved, she was still enslaved by a lie the Enemy uses against many of us: she felt she needed to be &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; to be accepted by herself, by others, and by God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea shares her struggle with life-threatening eating disorders and self-defeating thought patterns, and she reveals the beautiful discovery that God&amp;rsquo;s love meets us not in our perfection, but in the most unfinished places of our life. In &lt;em&gt;Perfectly Unfinished&lt;/em&gt;, Andrea exposes the powerful truth that continues to change her life: God loves us just as we are, just where we are; for it is in the midst of our brokenness and imperfections that Jesus is at work completing us so that we may share fully in his holiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside Andrea, readers discover from the word of God how to join God in the work he is doing in the midst of our unfinished and imperfect lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
