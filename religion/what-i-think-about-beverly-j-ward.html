  <title>What I Think About - Beverly J. Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are far too many people hurting and with feelings of being left out of the blessings of God. The church is busy dealing with the world and its worldly ways of living in this world. Not wanting to offend anyone, they sometimes look so much like the world that the Christian is finding it hard to separate themselves from the world. With Pop-Culture, Political Correctness, the New Normal, Rejection and other status-quo; the church must not be moved by the cares of this world, we must keep our eyes on the kingdom of God; our provider, the Lord our God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are called to live in this world but to not live like the world. This in itself can be a slippery slope if not followed cautiously and patiently with the Word of God.  We are commissioned by God to encourage the believer to live out their faith in Christ. I must tell them about Jesus and the rewards we as believer have in the anointed One. What I am doing is giving you key scriptures that has helped me to have a vital relationship with our heavenly Father, our brother and head of the church Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit, our guide in this life we live here on earth.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to honor God with all your heart, all your mind, and all your spirit! God would not have commanded us to live like that and not have made away for us to do just that. What I Think About, thinking like a Christian will help guide you into using the power you have within to please God and to walk in the authority you have in Christ. We have but one person to answer to and that being Jesus.&lt;p&gt;
