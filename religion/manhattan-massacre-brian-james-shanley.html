  <title>Manhattan Massacre - Brian James Shanley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever since that fateful day of September 11th, 2001, people all over America have been frantically searching for answers.  What was the attack about?  Why did it happen?  Who did it?  Will it ever happen again?  What do I need to know about Islam?  The literary world is flooded with books attempting to make sense out of it all, but many of them seem to be dancing around the hard questions and saying the same exact things.
In his debut book, Christian author Brian James Shanley comes onto the literary scene to address 09-11-2001, the religion of Islam, and the Islamic teaching of jihad.  This book rips the mask off of an evil religion and provides its readers with the real answers that government officials and news media people refuse to supply the average citizens with.
Every literate American should own a copy of this work, and every person seeking answers to their questions about Islam and terrorism should familiarize themselves with the facts presented in it.
What was the attack of 09-11-2001 really all about?  Do you have the courage to read the truth?  Check out the book that sheds new light on Americas darkest day.
Purchase this book and, for the first time, understand what America is being confronted by.  The problem is bigger, deeper, and more complex than what youre being told on TV!
This book so boldly tells the truth that it is causing an uproar in many parts of the country!  Dont be one of the only people to miss it.  Your home library is incomplete if you do not have a copy of MANHATTAN MASSACRE in it!" />
