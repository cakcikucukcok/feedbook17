  <title>Testimony Unveiled - Kristine Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Going through life without understanding is a difficult task. &amp;nbsp;We feel we are all alone, no one can relate, or we are helpless. &amp;nbsp;Countless times I wanted to give up, but held on to that drop of hope I felt deep within. &amp;nbsp;Despite the situation or how I felt, I continued on my journey. &amp;nbsp;I made some very bad choices, yet they lead me to all the right places in order to find the healing necessary to move forward. &amp;nbsp;Without knowing it, God had me all along. &amp;nbsp;To look back, I am able to see the miraculous triumphs that were overcome only by His grace and mercy. &amp;nbsp;Never would have made it rings loud in my ear when I look back and realize what I did not have to be brought through. &amp;nbsp;God had a plan for my life and I know He has a plan for you too. &amp;nbsp;I am called to share my journey with you in hopes that you are able to identify with the blessings in your life. &amp;nbsp;Different situations, but same outcome . . . Testify about the goodness of God through Jesus Christ who left us with the Holy Spirit to help and guide us along. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
