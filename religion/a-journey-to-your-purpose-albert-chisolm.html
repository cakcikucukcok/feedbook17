  <title>A Journey to Your Purpose - Albert Chisolm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A journey to your purpose must begin with the realization that God has created you with a purpose. Purpose is defined as Gods intention, plans, and will for your life. God and only God can reveal your purpose to you. This journey requires that you evaluate your spiritual heart, explore intimacy with God, and be willing to encounter the warmth of Gods love. God loves you, regardless of what you have or have not done. He will go the extra mile for you because you are valuable to Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A healthy spiritual heart is the key element in discovering your purpose. The healthier the spiritual heart is, the greater the connection with God. It is the heart that tells your true intent to God. Your heart is an important treasure to Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to discover your purpose with God, it must begin with an intimate relationship with Him. One must begin to inquire about who God is, what He does, how God thinks, and what His desires are. Intimate relationship with God simply means becoming spiritually connected, becoming close to God, and becoming one with Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warmth of Gods love is the only answer for a wounded heart and spirit. The warmth of Gods love is God knowing what you need to become functional again spiritually. He will give you what you need to restore and heal your wounded heart and spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
