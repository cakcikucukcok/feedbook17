  <title>The Treasure Is the Trip - P. J. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever wondered if God was thereor even if he was, that he cared? Have you ever gotten mad at God and thought you knew better? Have difficulties made you question Gods power, love, and goodness, or do you just feel impatient and lost? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In The Treasure Is the Trip: The Journey Has Its Rewards, author P. J. Brown shares her honest and inspiring personal story of spiritual growth over a lifetime. From her early years growing up to her marriage and subsequent entry into motherhood, Pat always believed in God and expected him to work things out. But her relationship with God was not what it could have been, and Pat could not escape a feeling of being lost. So with a lot of prayer and perseverance, she would make the choice to seek God firsta decision that would later give her and her family the strength to face traumatic loss. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While most of us are looking for the treasure, its the journey that is most important. The treasure is the trip; the destination is heaven. The destination is in Gods hands, but the trip is in ours. We have the directions, the Word of God, and we have the guide, which is the Holy Spirit; we will get to our destination, but will God get the glory on our trip?" />
