  <title>Hannah&#39;s Voice - Onedia Nicole Gage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God used Hannah to prove a point. When God selected Hannah to show us who He is and what He is capable of, it also showed us what Hannah does in the face of adversity. Hannah does what most of us will not do: Pray.&amp;nbsp; Pray when life is good, or bad. Pray when life is fabulous and when life is horrible. Pray no matter what others say about your prayer life. Most of us shut down, act out and dismiss God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we pray? When we pray, as we should, we are in communion with God. We are in communication with God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah was an excellent choice for prayer and worship, revelation and reward. We need to use these sermons to grow up. Maturity in God requires prayer. Maturity in Christ requires prayer. Maturity as a Christian who leads others to Christ requires prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah exhibits maturity and she exhibits forgiveness and she exhibits character. Hannah teaches us how to pray. There is nothing that matters like prayer. God has commanded it. Jesus teaches it. The Holy Spirits shares it. Hannah does it. We should do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prayer is an essential conversation with God so that we can confess, share, and love God back for the abounding and unconditional love He gives us. Consider that God gives you a chance daily to talk to Him and sometimes we deny ourselves the greatest opportunity to share with God Almighty the very detail He wants to trust us with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prayer is a journey: a Spiritual Journey. A journey where we reach God in a different way. One that tells everyone that God is first and where He reinforces His sacrificial love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no excuses. Nothing is hard for God. Nothing is new to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pray. Hannah did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
