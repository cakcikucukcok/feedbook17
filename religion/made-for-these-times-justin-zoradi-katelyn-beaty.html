  <title>Made for These Times - Justin Zoradi, Katelyn Beaty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In fearful, uncertain times, how can we find significance in something greater than ourselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning social entrepreneur Justin Zoradi was once haunted by this question as a young person daunted by the world&#39;s needs, yet wanting to make a difference. But when some friends from across the world invited him to join them, Justin said yes - and felt a small spark ignite within. That spark led to the founding of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;These Numbers Have Faces&lt;/em&gt;, a social enterprise investing in the next generation of African leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Made For These Times&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is a field guide to help you find your own spark as you remember who you were made to be. Through 26 power-packed microchapters, you will learn how to bolster ambition with character, dig deep to find your grit, and rise up to the challenges of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Justin weaves together compelling narrative, historical anecdotes, practical tips, and a six-part road map to equip you to join God in the work he is already doing. The result is a hope-filled blueprint for fighting back against fear and building a life of purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life of significance isn&#39;t about what you are doing, it&#39;s about who you are becoming. In these trying times, God is calling you to be brave.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Made For These Times&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is a rallying declaration that we cannot rely on the heroes of the past to engage the challenges of today. It&#39;s your turn &amp;ndash; let this book be the spark you&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
