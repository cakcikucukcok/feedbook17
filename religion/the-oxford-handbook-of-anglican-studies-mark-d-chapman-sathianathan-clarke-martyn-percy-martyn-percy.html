  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Anglican Studies - Mark D. Chapman, Sathianathan Clarke, Martyn Percy, Martyn Percy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Anglican Communion is the third largest Christian denomination and claims a membership of some 80 million members in about 164 countries. Given that there are only around two hundred countries in the world, this makes the churches of the Anglican Communion the most geographically widespread denomination after Roman Catholicism. The 44 essays in this volume embrace a wide range of academic disciplines: theological; historical; demography and geography; and
different aspects of culture and ethics. They are united in their discussion of what is effectively a new inter-disciplinary subject which we have termed &#39;Anglican Studies&#39;. At the core of this volume is the phenomenon of &#39;Anglicanism&#39; as this is expressed in different places and in a variety of ways across
the world.
This Handbook covers a far broader set of topics from a wider range of perspectives than has been hitherto attempted in Anglican Studies. At the same time, it doesn&#39;t impose a particular theological or historical agenda. The contributions are drawn from across the spectrum of theological views and opinions. It shows that the unsettled nature of the polity is part of its own rich history; and many will see this as a somewhat lustrous tradition. In its comprehensive coverage, this volume
is a valuable contribution to Anglican Studies and helps formulate a discipline that might perhaps promote dialogue and discussion across the Anglican world." />
