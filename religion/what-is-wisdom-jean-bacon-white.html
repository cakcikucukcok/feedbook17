  <title>What Is Wisdom - Jean Bacon White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The brain is a material part of the body contained within the skull. It is sensitized to absorb all information sent to it from inside and outside of the body. It contains the means to process this information and pass it on to the mind, which is not a material part of the body, but lies somewhere in the brain. You can lose it, abuse it or use it in your search for wisdom. &lt;br /&gt;
If you lose it, we may find that you are demented, diseased, or even insane or a fool who has destroyed it with things that have taken away its usefulness. Men have been studying these mysteries for centuries. &lt;br /&gt;
No one has been able to unlock the matter of the brain, the shadow of the mind, or the secrets therein, where we also have a soul and a conscience. &lt;br /&gt;
The brain is a receiver, the mind is the decision maker, the conscience passes judgement. There is also a spirit that is the self, which is in control, and in the Christian, a Holy Spirit which guards the soul. &lt;br /&gt;
Much has been written about the brain in the physical. Scientific, and psychological realms, concerning what the so- called grey matter in our heads is all about. This book is not concerned with those things, only the parts that no one can figure out. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wisdom is what makes good people nice. Derek Kidner &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next thing to being wise ones-self is to live in a circle of those who are. C. S. Lewis &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The task thy wisdom hath assigned, O let me cheerfully fulfill; In all my works thy presence find, and prove thy good and perfect will. Wesley&lt;/p&gt;" />
