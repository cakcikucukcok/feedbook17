  <title>Bible Brain Bogglers Volume I - Kevan J Kennington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The King James Version of the Bible was used while writing this book. Therefore, when you are trying to solve some of the bogglers in this book, the King James Version would more than likely be of more help than other versions. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great blessings of todays technology is our ability to have the Bible at our fingertips at all times. My wife and I have two cell phones, two iPads, two computers, and they all have the Bible downloaded on them. No matter where we are, the Bible is in close proximity to us. Therefore, this book can be enjoyed almost anywhere you might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my hope that this book will encourage you to spend more time in the Bible, even if it is through the use of an electronic device on which you have downloaded the Bible. Thus, the main purpose of this book is fourfold:&lt;/p&gt;
 To persuade you to spend more time reading and pondering the contents of the Bible.
 To provide you with some entertainment and knowledge that will be of eternal value to you. 
 To bring to your remembrance those sacred truths taught by the Savior, his prophets and apostles, which will spiritually lift you. 
 To provide an enjoyable alternative to TV, video games, and other entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;" />
