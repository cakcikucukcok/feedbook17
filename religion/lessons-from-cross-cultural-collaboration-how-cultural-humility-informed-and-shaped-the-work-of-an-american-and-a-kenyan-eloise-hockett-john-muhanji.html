  <title>Lessons from Cross-Cultural Collaboration: How Cultural Humility Informed and Shaped the Work of an American and a Kenyan - Eloise Hockett, John Muhanji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How should we positively interact with others from all types of backgrounds in ways that acknowledge God&#39;s diversity in the world? What are effective ways to engage in cross-cultural collaboration endeavors that honor and respect the culture of those involved with our efforts? The principles of cultural humility, beginning with intentional relationship building, provide a framework that can guide our cross-cultural interactions and partnerships with others both locally and globally, in ways that respect both the culture and backgrounds of others. In this book, Eloise Hockett and John Muhanji share their unique experiences of cross-cultural collaboration using the principles of cultural humility, primarily in Kenya. From Mt. Elgon, to a village in rural Kenya, to working with teachers in schools, John and Eloise describe each project through the lens and perspective of an American and a Kenyan. Within these narratives, Eloise and John also share their journey of how they learned to engage and work with one another and learn from each other. John and Eloise believe their collaborative efforts incorporating the themes of cultural humility fully demonstrate how God can work through each person regardless of their cultural background, in order to carry out His plan in the world." />
