      <meta name="description" content="Drawing on his background, experience, and interests, coupled with using golf literature and playing golf for 67 plus years, Dr. DeVore has a created masterful work of art that can support the efforts of an average golfer to accomplish golf goals and to become his or her best coach and caddie.
Dr. DeVore combines personal experience, training, and education to make learning golf an experience for life. He brings a fresh perspective to the game of golf in Golfers Palette.
-Tim Eberlein, MBA, PGA Master Professional, Campus Director, The Golf Academy of America-Phoenix, www.golfacademyofamerica.edu
In my 20 plus years as a PGA instructor, Dr. DeVore was one of the most interesting and knowledgeable students that ever passed through the doors of The Golf Academy of America. It was always special to pick his brain regarding various journeys in life. When he had a story to tell, I listened until the story was complete because I knew he had lived the story. With his experience traveling around the world, working with corporate America, and his love of the game of golf, I know that Golfers Palette is based purely on his experience and not on a fairytale.
