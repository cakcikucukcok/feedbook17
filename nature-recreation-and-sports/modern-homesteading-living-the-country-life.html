  <title>Modern Homesteading - Living the Country Life</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An accessible guide for the aspiring modern homesteader from the craftsmen at Living the Country Life magazine! Grow your own crops, raise backyard animals, and preserve your bounty for the winter months and beyond.  
Once upon a time, people had a real connection with the land. Instead of being mere consumers, they were producers and makers. Traditional skills were learned to eliminate a reliance on others, enabling the self-sufficiency that’s at the heart of the Do-It-Yourself movement. And this artisanal wisdom was passed on to family and friends.
The editors at Living the Country Life magazine have collected this essential expertise into Modern Homesteading, a guide to rediscovering the crucial skills to truly go from farm to table. Whether you live in the country or just want to reconnect with nature in your own backyard, Modern Homesteading provides guidance to:
* Build a chicken coop, raise and care for chicks, and produce farm-fresh eggs for the breakfast table
* Grow your own fruits, vegetables, grains, and herbs for a healthy and delicious bounty
* Preserve and can your favorite fruits and vegetables to enjoy their flavors throughout the year
* Customize your garden for a harmonious mix of plants that yield what you need, when you need it
Whether you’re raising urban chickens behind your Brooklyn brownstone or feeding your family from a front-yard organic veggie plot, this book can bring a little self-sufficiency into any life." />
