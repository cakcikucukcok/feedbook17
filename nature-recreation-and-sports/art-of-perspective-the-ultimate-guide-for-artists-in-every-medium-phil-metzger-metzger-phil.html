  <title>Art of Perspective: The Ultimate Guide for Artists in Every Medium - Phil Metzger, Metzger Phil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;Everything you need to know to put your drawings and paintings into perspective!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the concept of perspective makes you think of confusing angles, fancy measuring gadgets and complicated theories, get ready for a very pleasant surprise. In this comprehensive guide, Phil Metzger demystifies perspective, presenting it simply as a matter of mimicking the way we see--like the way a distant mountain appears blue, or a road seems to narrow in the distance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Art of Perspective&lt;/i&gt; offers simple but powerful techniques for achieving a convincing illusion of depth and distance, whether it&#39;s a few inches in a still life or miles in a landscape.&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Start simple, with atmospheric perspective and intuitive techniques, and gradually progress to linear perspective and more complex challenges such as stairways, curves and reflections.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use the engaging, step-by-step demonstrations and exercises to try out each essential concept for yourself, making lessons clearer and more memorable.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn theories that apply to all mediums, with specific advice for achieving effects using acrylic, oil, watercolor and pencil.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get the inside scoop on professional tricks and shortcuts that make perspective easier than ever!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Forget everything you think you know (or don&#39;t know) about perspective. This book builds an easy-to-follow, ground-up understanding of how to turn a flat painting or drawing surface into a living, breathing, dimensional scene that lures viewers in. No matter how you look at it, it&#39;s the ultimate guide to perspective for artists of every medium and skill level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
