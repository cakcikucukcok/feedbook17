  <title>Samurai Strategies: 42 Martial Secrets from Musashi&#39;s Book of Five Rings - Boye Lafayette De Mente, Michihiro Matsumoto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Similar to &lt;I&gt;The Art of War&lt;/I&gt; by Sun Tzu, &lt;I&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/I&gt; by Musashi Myamoto, Japan&#39;s most famous warrior and combat strategist, provides valuable lessons for anyone facing challenging circumstances&amp;#8212;from business, war, and sports to fields of art, love, and politics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The samurai culture, created over a period of nearly seven hundred years by Japan&#39;s ruling class of warriors and epitomized in &lt;I&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/I&gt;, still influences every facet of the Japanese way of thinking and doing things. Many Japanese, consciously and unconsciously, pattern their attitudes and behavior on the thinking and behavior of Musashi, including sacrificing themselves to ideals, and continuously striving to achieve perfection.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Boye Lafayette De Mente has extracted the fundamentals of Musashi&#39;s martial tactics and explains them here in a context for use in the modern world. These strategies for winning are as valid today as they were in 17th century Japan and provide valuable insights for anyone in any field to endeavor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This hardcover edition of &lt;I&gt;Samurai Strategies&lt;/I&gt; features a new introduction by the author, and additional commentary in each chapter by renowned Japanese author and samurai expert Michihiro Matsumoto.&lt;/div&gt;" />
