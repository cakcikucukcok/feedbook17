  <title>The Loyal Lieutenant - George Hincapie, Craig Hummer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Trading on the sterling reputation that enabled him to survive a widely publicized doping confession, American cyclist &amp;#8220;Big George&amp;#8221; Hincapie&amp;#8212;a record seventeen-time Tour de France participant, Olympian, and key witness in the Lance Armstrong doping case&amp;#8212;offers an insightful account of his esteemed career and a sports era defined by performance-enhancing drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this highly anticipated cycling memoir, Big George Hincapie provides the most comprehensive account of a dark period in professional cycling, in which doping scandals have decimated the careers of some of the top athletes in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Loyal Lieutenant&lt;/em&gt; reveals how Hincapie&amp;#8217;s life has been intrinsically tied to the sport he loves, from his earliest days in Queens, where he was influenced by his Colombian father&amp;#8217;s love of cycling and the Colombian &amp;#8220;cycling warrior&amp;#8221; archetype. Hincapie takes us through his amateur years to the Olympics, and chronicles his exhilarating ride as a professional, including finding his true calling as Lance Armstrong&amp;#8217;s most prized &amp;#8220;domestique&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;leading his then best friend to seven straight Tour de France victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hincapie speaks openly about his relationship with Armstrong, how he himself began doping, and why he quit long before the headline-making revelations. His personal evolution is the journey of a man dedicated to coming clean about his past and to restore honor to the sport he loves.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
