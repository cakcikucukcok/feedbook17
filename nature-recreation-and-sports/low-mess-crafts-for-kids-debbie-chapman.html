  <title>Low-Mess Crafts for Kids - Debbie Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Messy crafts have met their match&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with these 72 creations that keep out the clutter and mess but pack in the fun and creativity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When craft time rolls around, parents usually cringe at the thought of a creativity storm&#39;s aftermath. Glue, glitter, globs of paint--it all adds up to Mom and Dad assisting (let&#39;s be honest, doing everything) with cleanup. But Debbie Chapman--the supermom behind One Little Project --keeps that freshly cleaned kitchen table in mind with tips to keep these tutorials as mess-free as possible. With tricks like twisting pipe cleaners into fun shapes to avoid glue and using brightly colored cups and patterned paper to avoid paint, Debbie shows that keeping it simple doesn&#39;t mean play time has to be less fun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Low-Mess Crafts for Kids &lt;/i&gt;brings parents and caretakers solutions to the craft time conundrum. As well as being low-mess, all 72 of these awesome projects feature everyday items like pipe cleaners, pom poms and clothespins, which make playtime a cinch. And with step-by-step pictures, kids of any age can create something they can be proud of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch as little ones create their own enchanting worlds--whether they want to explore outer space with a Paper Plate Flying Saucer, race cars on a Poster Board Road Track, or create a whimsical fairy city with Paper Roll Fairy Houses, each craft promises to spark your child&#39;s imagination while leaving you stress free and ready to play along.&lt;/p&gt;" />
