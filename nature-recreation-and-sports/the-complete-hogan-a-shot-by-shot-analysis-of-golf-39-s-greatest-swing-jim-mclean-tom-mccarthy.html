  <title>The Complete Hogan: A Shot-By-Shot Analysis of Golf&#39;s Greatest Swing - Jim McLean, Tom Mccarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Top golfing instructor Jim McLean uses rare film footage of Ben Hogan to break down the greatest swing of all time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golf legend Ben Hogan had the perfect golf swing, but how exactly it worked has long been a mystery?until now. Using footage from three never-before analyzed films of Hogan at his very best, Jim McLean analyzes the crucial motions of Hogan&#39;s entire golf swing and shows you how to integrate his mechanics into your own game. You&#39;ll study Hogan&#39;s blend of club head, club shaft, hands, ankles, knees, hops, shoulders, and head motion?a symphony of movements with an ideal sequential development of power. It&#39;s as close as you can get to teeing it up with Hogan yourself.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uses more than one hundred stills from three rare films to analyze every key detail of Hogan&#39;s perfect swing before the car accident that changed his play, something no book on Hogan has ever done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reveals the fifteen secrets of Hogan&#39;s swing, covering important topics such as the grip, the waggle, the left hip action, lateral motion, rotation and turning movements, head position, and more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draws extensively on the knowledge of Hogan&#39;s friends and competitors, many of them golfing greats themselves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Written by one of Golf Digest&#39;s top five teachers , a pioneer in video analysis who also saw Hogan play first hand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been many books on Hogan&#39;s swing, but never one, including his own, that illustrates his swing at its most perfect, and never one that shows its mechanics so clearly and completely." />
