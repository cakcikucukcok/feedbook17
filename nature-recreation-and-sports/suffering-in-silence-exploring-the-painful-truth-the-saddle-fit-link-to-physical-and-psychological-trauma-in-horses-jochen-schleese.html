  <title>Suffering in Silence: Exploring the Painful Truth: The Saddle-Fit Link to Physical and Psychological Trauma in Horses - Jochen Schleese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Humans and horses have been joined for thousands of years, and for much of that time, one thing has served as the primary point of physical contact between them: the saddle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, for many horses and many riders, the saddle has been no less than a refined means of torture. Horses have long suffered from tree points impeding the movement of their shoulder blades; too narrow gullet channels damaging the muscles and nerves along the vertebrae; and too long panels putting harmful pressure on the reflex point in the loin area. Male riders saddle up despite riding-related pain and the potential for serious side effects, such as impotence, while female riders endure backache, slipped discs, and bladder infections, to name just a few common issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;We must ask ourselves: How much better could we ride and how much better could our horses perform if our saddles fit optimally? If they accommodated the horse&amp;#8217;s unique conformation and natural asymmetry? If they were built for the differing anatomy of men and women?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answers to all these questions are right here, right now, in this book.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
