Its route along the Continental Divide goes through the heart of the Rocky Mountains and involves more than 200,000 feet of ascent&amp;#151;the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest seven times.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The other problem is that &lt;B&gt;Howard&lt;/B&gt; has never owned a mountain bike&amp;#151;and how will training on the South Downs in southern England prepare him for sleeping rough in the Rockies?
