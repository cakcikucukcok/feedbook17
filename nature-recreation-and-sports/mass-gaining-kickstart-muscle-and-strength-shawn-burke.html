As different as these two goals are, the exercises needed to reach them are actually the same. However, your approach is significantly different.&lt;br /&gt;
Before you really get started with muscle building, you need to recognize which of these two groups you&amp;rsquo;re in. Are you building muscle because you want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or because you&amp;rsquo;re going for more of a runner&amp;rsquo;s lean build?&lt;br /&gt;
