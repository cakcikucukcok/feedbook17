  <title>Go Blue Devils! - Jim Elworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Plattsmouth, Nebraska lies at the confluence of the Platte and Missouri rivers. The people of Plattsmouth are proud of their small towns rich history, of their strength and determination as a community. They also share something that larger towns cannot, something that for generations has helped unite them and shape their very lives. What they share is a community-wide excitement on fall Friday nights, the rush of a close game, the heartbreaking losses, the exhilaration of a big win  what they share is the Plattsmouth Blue Devils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Go Blue Devils!: A History of Plattsmouth High School Football, 1893 1979&lt;/i&gt;, by former Plattsmouth resident Jim Elworth, presents a one-of-a-kind account of a high school football team and the town that has rallied around it for more than one hundred years. Elworths comfortable and at times humorous prose brings us season after season of game-day excitement, rendered in detail from years of researching and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;Go Blue Devils!&lt;/i&gt; is more than a story of game scores. It is a history of accomplished, hard working, down-to-earth townspeople. It is a history of the town itself, told through the exploits of local boys giving their all on the fields of sport. It is a story of those local boys inspiring their community and going on to live rich, positive and valuable lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
