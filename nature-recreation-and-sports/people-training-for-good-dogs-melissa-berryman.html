      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine your reaction if your childs friend grabs the remote control of the TV you are watching and changes the channeland then later, does it again.

Berryman shows how analyzing situations and contexts can stop the cycle of preventable incidents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written with humor and compassion, &lt;em&gt;People Training for Good Dogs&lt;/em&gt; offers insight into the impact that human behavior and understanding have on our relationships with dogs. By working with core canine social and behavioral drives, Berryman provides owners with sound techniques that focus on safety and can help protect their liability in todays world.&lt;/p&gt;
