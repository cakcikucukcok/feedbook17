  <title>Clubhouse Confidential - Luis Castillo, William Cane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clubhouse Confidential &lt;i&gt;is the explosive, inside story of Yankees players and managers by a bat boy who saw it all&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are invited to come behind the closed doors of the Yankees&#39; clubhouse for the ride of your life in this intimate memoir about the team&#39;s recent glory years and the superstars who made it all possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, Luis &quot;Squeegee&quot; Castillo, bat boy and clubbie for the Yankees from 1998 to 2005, talks about working with Derek Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, Mariano Rivera, Joe Girardi, Bernie Williams, Roger Clemens, Joe Torre, and many other modern-day Yankee greats. Luis saw and heard what really happened in the privacy of the clubhouse, at parties, and in hotel rooms, bar fights, and secret meetings from Miami to St. Louis, from Detroit to Arizona, and from Toronto to New York. He even vacationed with some players and got to know them like family, discovering their pitching and hitting secrets, joining them in all-nighters, and learning their often hilarious methods of meeting girls and having fun on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a fly on the wall, Luis takes you backstage to show you how A-Rod&#39;s bragging when he hits home runs annoys teammates. Discover how manager Joe Torre checks racing results during games. Hear what happens inside the sanctity of the clubhouse after Roger Clemens beans Mets catcher Mike Piazza and then-a few months later during the 2000 World Series-throws a bat at him. Find out how Mariano Rivera eats junk food during games, why Posada routinely fights with El Duque, what Jeter is really saying to players on other teams as he rounds the bases, and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows what happened on the field. Now pull up a chair and enjoy the secret stories that only Luis can tell about what really happened behind the scenes-and why.&lt;/p&gt;" />
