  <title>Relentless - Mary White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p &gt;&lt;i&gt;Relentless&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of the rise of Cork ladies football between 2005 and 2016. Having never won a senior title in the sport in 2004, by 2016 the team had won ten All-Ireland
titles in eleven years. Mary White takes the reader behind the scenes and shows
what made the Cork ladies footballers one of the most successful teams ever in
the history of Irish sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;The
book was shortlisted for the 2015 Setanta Ireland Sports Book of the Year. This
edition contains a new afterword from the author, bringing the story up to the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;&lt;i&gt;‘It would have been disastrous if
the best team in Irish sport had passed into history without their story being
told. Luckily for them and for us, Mary White was there taking notes right from
the beginning and can give an outsider’s view with an insider’s knowledge. It’s
not often that happens. A great insight into a truly great team.’&lt;/i&gt; – Malachy Clerkin, &lt;i&gt;The Irish Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
