  <title>Playing with the Masters - Blackjack Jeff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Jeff Friend I have 33 years experience in playing the game of blackjack. I think of this game as a sport, and being a good team player. Having good manners and respect for others is so important. I believe people will enjoy reading this book because it teaches, most miss played hands and good common sense plays, and why we do them. At the end of the day hopefully, you have made some money and gained some friends at the table. In 2010, I was one of the top contenders in tournament play and one of the most consistent winners. Its not how much you win, its how consistent you win. So many times I am asked to help new players, how to play the game and its always a privilege to help others. Remember we were all beginners at sometime. The friendships you gain will always be remembered. Thats how I gained the name of blackjack Jeff. I always wear a black hat, black coat, and when ever Im in the casinos, dealers pit boss, and players that know me always have fun." />
