  <title>Balls! - Gail W. Braman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
Read what the golf critics are saying about BALLS!:
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
* THE GOLF COLLECTORS SOCIETY BULLETIN - 3/2001
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
Gail W. Braman has written BALLS! (Confessions of a Rural Golf Course Owner).  This is the story of the insanely odd and crazy people who frequent a nine-hole golf course beside Route 100 in Rochester, Vermont.  The stories are so nearly unbelievable that one would think that the book is fiction, but I can personally vouch for the authenticity because I lived just a few miles from the course and have heard the inane questions and observed the outrageous behavior first hand...
I have been hearing about this book for years and the fact that it is finally in print, despite the odds inherent in the publishing world, is a testament to the chutzpah and perseverance of Gail Braman.  She owned the course,
and as such interacted with the people, recorded her astute observations when it was all over and got it down on paper.  Youll enjoy the tale.     -Bob Labbance, Editor
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
* GOLF BUSINESS(Natl Golf Course Owners Assoc)- 2/2001
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
Gail Braman made the mistake of telling her recently retired husband that she didnt want him home for lunch.  So, he went out and purchased a 
nine-hole golf course in rural Rochester, Vermont.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Braman captures this nine-year adventure as golf course owners.  Through the pages of this account, youre invited inside their world as inexperienced golf course owners, where you learn what really happens behind the scenes through humorous vignettes and anecdotes.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
* HEARTHSTONE REVIEW (Duly Noted) - 4/01
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
A little investment property in bucolic Vermont, a pleasant summer-time diversion.  That was the plan anyway.  Before opening day was flooded out.
Before the backhoes cleaning up the debris inflicted further damage.  Before the discouraging
financial realities set in, running a remote homespun golf course overshadowed by two tony resorts (The Hertz and Avis to their little 9-hole Rent A Wreck).  The claustrophic Vermont golf season didnt help.  Nor did the vagaries of
New England weather, a shortage of tourist center
bathrooms or characters straight from central casting.  For nearly a decade it sure made life interesting for Herb and Gail Braman." />
