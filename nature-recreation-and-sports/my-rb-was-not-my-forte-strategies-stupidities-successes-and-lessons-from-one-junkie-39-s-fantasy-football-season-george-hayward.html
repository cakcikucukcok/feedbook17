      <meta name="description" content="&quot;My RB Was Not My Forte&quot; is unlike other fantasy football resources-a combination draft guide and handbook to help you manage your team through the panic-inducing seasonal rollercoaster of injuries, slumps and upsets. Told as a diary of one team&#39;s 2011 season in a long-running keeper league, &quot;My RB...&quot; includes 25 years of fantasy football experience and insight on roster planning and trading, including two chapters on keeper leagues, and the principle of Pragmatic Paranoia-seven crises you&#39;re sure to face in your fantasy season. There are no cheat sheets here, but a draft guide of just a few simple steps to get the most value out of any cheat sheet you use. You&#39;ll see first-hand how to field and maintain a competitive team and often, what not to do! Whether you&#39;re a novice or hardcore fantasy footballer, you&#39;ll enjoy an up-and-down ride through one venerable franchise&#39;s season and pick up a career&#39;s worth of knowledge and advice, hopefully on the way to your fantasy playoffs!" />
