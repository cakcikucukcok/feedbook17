      <meta name="description" content="Every fan of professional wrestling remembers the moment that captured their heart forever and hooked them for life. Whether it was Ric Flair regaining the NWA Championship from Harley Race at Starcade, the Freebirds turning heel on Kerry Von Erich, Mick Foley flying off the cage at King of the Ring, Jake Roberts DDT-ing Ricky Steamboat on the concrete, Samoa Joe&#39;s epic trilogy with CM Punk in Ring of Honor, or the premiere of WCW&#39;s Nitro: these are the matches and moments that thrilled, terrified, or outraged - overwhelming you with real emotion.
Mike Rickard&#39;s Wrestling&#39;s Greatest Moments brings you all the most memorable and controversial moments from modern wrestling history. It&#39;s an insightful and essential compendium of thirty years&#39; worth of groundbreaking matches, angles and interviews. From Hulkamania to the Montreal &quot;screwjob,&quot; from the NWA to the nWo, you&#39;ll rediscover what really occurred in arenas and on the air worldwide, and learn all the backstage and behind-the-scenes secrets that made these highlight-reel moments possible from the men and women who were there. 
Whether you watched Stone Cold Steve Austin point a gun at WWE honcho Vince McMahon&#39;s head, or stood outside the building as D-Generation X &quot;invaded&quot; WCW; whether you look back with nostalgia to &quot;The King&quot; slapping Andy Kaufman silly on Letterman or believe wrestling was better when Bruno sold out Shea; whether you were one of the Philadelphia &quot;bingo hall&quot; faithful who made ECW &quot;extreme&quot; or a casual observer of the Monday Night Wars; whether you&#39;re reliving these moments or discovering them for the first time, Wrestling&#39;s Greatest Moments will enthrall you with the exploits and extravagance, the tragedies and triumphs of the sport of kings." />
