  <title>Pilgrimage to Vallombrosa: From Vermont to Italy in the Footsteps of George Perkins Marsh - John Elder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Set aside your &lt;i&gt;Bella Tuscanys&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Year in     Provences&lt;/i&gt; for a different kind of travel book. &lt;i&gt;Pilgrimage to     Vallombrosa&lt;/i&gt; puts a walking stick in your hand and &lt;i&gt;Marsh&#39;s Man and     Nature &lt;/i&gt;in your knapsack, exploring how Italians have managed their natural and     cultural heritage in ways that sustain both. John Elder&#39;s poetic meditations on land and     life demonstrate that only by searching beyond our familiar boundaries can we discover better     ways of living back at home.&quot;-Marcus Hall, author of &lt;i&gt;Earth Repair: A Transatlantic     History of Environmental Restoration&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;This     collaboration-between George Perkins Marsh and John Elder, between Vermont and Italy, between     maple and olive-is one of the smartest, soundest, deepest books about the relationship between     people and nature that I&#39;ve ever read. It will be a classic.&quot;-Bill McKibben, author     of &lt;i&gt;The End of Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Elder&#39;s impassioned     pilgrimage shows us how to delight in messy wilderness, to secure a curative habitation of the     world, and, with Marsh, to lend ecological nous to our gravest task: knowing ourselves and     respecting one another. Let the maple seeds and olive stones of Elder&#39;s visionary harvest     restore to us a reflective and redemptory future.&quot;-from the foreword by David     Lowenthal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pivotal figure in &lt;i&gt;Pilgrimage to Vallombrosa&lt;/i&gt;     is the nineteenth-century diplomat and writer George Perkins Marsh, generally regarded as     America&#39;s first environmentalist. Like Elder, Marsh was a Vermonter, and his diplomatic     career took him for some years to Italy, where, witnessing the ecological devastation wrought     upon the landscape by runaway deforestation and the plundering of other natural resources, he     was moved to produce his famous manifesto, &lt;i&gt;Man and Nature.&lt;/i&gt; Marsh drew     parallels between the despoiled Italian environment and his home landscape of Vermont, warning     that the latter was vulnerable to ecological woes of a similar magnitude if not carefully     maintained and protected. In short, his was a prescient voice for     stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elder follows in Marsh&#39;s footsteps along a trajectory     running from Vermont to Italy, and at length fetches up at the managed forest of Vallombrosa.     Punctuated throughout with learned and genial considerations of the poetry of Wordsworth, Basho,     Dante, and Frost, Elder&#39;s narrative takes up issues of sustainability as practiced     locally, reports on family doings, and returns finally-as did Marsh&#39;s-to Vermont, where he     measures traditional stewardship values against more aggressive conservation-oriented measures     such as the expansion of wilderness areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Elder, Professor of English     and Environmental Studies at Middlebury College, is the author of &lt;i&gt;Reading the Mountains     of Home and The Frog Run.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Sign of Nature: Explorations in     Ecocriticism&lt;/p&gt;" />
