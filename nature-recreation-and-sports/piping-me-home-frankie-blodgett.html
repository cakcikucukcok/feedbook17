  <title>Piping Me Home - Frankie Blodgett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is an arduous journey from 1944 to 2014 for the world is constantly changing. Some of these changes have been difficult to accept. However the one stable soothing factor in my life has been NATURES calming influence. 
This Book begins with my childhood as a boy growing-up in Chenango Forks, a small town located in upstate New York. My home was on the CHENANGO RIVER, which was my introduction to the amazing World of Nature. I was so enthralled with the natural world that I dedicated the whole second chapter to it. Here is an excerpt from my poem, PURE MOUNTAINS STILL: 
Of poetry and song, the mountains eer ring 
For the muses of Parnassus still do sing. 
The glorious alpenglow still greet the eye 
And the slopes are still teaming with butterflies. 
The third chapter is devoted entirely to the oceans and the seas of the world. This topic continues throughout the book from the first poem: FREE AT SEA which describes how deeply I love the sea to my last poem in this chapter: WITH THE POETS, I AGREE 
The prism arcs of the rain bowed spray, 
Beauteously appeared in an amazing array; 
While the mystic flight of the blown spume, 
Frothed spiritedly from the breakers womb. 
The next several chapters deal with my Navy years, my faith and freedom. This is an excerpt from my poem: FREE SPIRIT: 
Freedom is a glorious state 
Far above the bonds of man, 
She floats upon the wings of the wind 
And never makes a plan. 
The eighth chapter is the theme of the book: PIPING ME HOME. In this chapter are found many poems reflecting my opinions of reality and lifes end, including: PREDETERMINED FATE, ICE BOUND NO MORE and the title poem of the book: PIPING ME HOME. Finally the last chapter: JUST FOR FUN is a collection of light poems-ENJOY!!" />
