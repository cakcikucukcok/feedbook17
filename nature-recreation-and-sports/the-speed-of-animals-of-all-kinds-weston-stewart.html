  <title>The Speed of Animals of All Kinds - Weston Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, The Speed of Animals of All Kinds: Fastest to Slowest, is very unique because there is no other book on this subject that explains and gives the detailed information in the form of a rhyming poem. This book includes true facts about the animals presented, including what they each must do to survive in the wild and the realities of the world they live in. 
The beautiful pictures and poems that accompany each description of the animals will surely inspire interest and a great appreciation for nature and the lifestyles of the animals displayed. This is a very fun, educational book that is not only geared toward exciting the imaginations of children but of adults as well. 
This book is filled with facts that have been proven; thus, it is information that will never be outdated. This makes it a wonderful book to pass down to each generation and something that any library could keep in circulation.
I started writing this book nine years ago when I was inspired by the struggle of different animals that had gone extinct and wondered how each animal survived out in the harsh and dangerous world. After gathering up all the information that I could about different animals, the idea came to me to write about the survival of each animal in a way that could easily be understood by children. 
Once I had written the poems, I began to research how to put these poems together in book form and share it with my own children and grandchildren. Creating this book, starting my own company, self-publishing my book, and beginning this journey to having it sold in stores has been a long and sometimes frustrating process, but Im determined to see it through. At the end of the day, knowing that this book I have created will educate and brighten the imaginations of children is the greatest gift I can imagine. 
Im very proud of the book that Ive put together. It has always been a goal in my life to educate others and provide everyone with the opportunity to learn in a safe and fun way. Education is the key to understanding and appreciating all lives on this earth. 
Please read a book, you might just get hooked!
Respectfully,
Mr. Weston Stewart" />
