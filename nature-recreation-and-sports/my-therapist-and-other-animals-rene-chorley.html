  <title>My Therapist and Other Animals - Rene Chorley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;An animal is a prescription without side effects.&quot; Do you love animals? Do you feel a connection with a furry friend? Do you believe animals offer something that can touch and heal a human heart? My Therapist and Other Animals tells of the healing bond that can be created when animals are participants in our lives. These true stories document the loving connection between humans and those with whom we share a planet. Written by René Chorley, an experienced attachment therapist, it illustrates how animals can reach through the pain of abuse, neglect and trauma and reignite the ability to feel safe, cared for and valued. Animals can make a difference in our lives. They are consistent and unconditional in their time, attention and affection, qualities that may be missing in the lives of so many. Each story brings to life a connection - whether it be an exceptional dog offering friendship or a squeaky guinea pig excited for feed time, our importance in their lives feeds our self-worth. These heart-warming stories prove that this connection has the power to overcome all." />
