  <title>Dogs That Bite and Fight: A Guide for Owners and Trainers - David Ryan Pg Dip (Cabc), Ccab</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are thinking of buying a puppy or adopting a rescue dog, if you have a dog that has started biting or fighting, or if you would just like to further your knowledge of dog behaviour and training, Dogs that Bite and Fight provides a complete understanding of why pet dogs become biters and fighters, how to prevent it and how to change the behaviour, including training methods that owners can use with their own pets. David Ryan was a police dog handler and instructor for twenty-six years. He cut his teeth on dogs that bite and fight, teaching them how to moderate and direct aggression proportionately. He qualified with a Postgraduate Diploma in Companion Animal Behaviour Counselling, and his hands-on up-close manipulation of canine aggression was a useful grounding when he transferred his skills to dealing with pet dogs as one of the UK&#39;s leading canine behaviourists." />
