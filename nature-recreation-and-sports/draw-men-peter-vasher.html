  <title>Draw Men - Peter Vasher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Excel and learn to draw like a pro in simple steps and with easy explanations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s going to take some time to learn how to draw, but when you know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, the process will be so much faster. As an experienced artist, ex-art-college student, teacher, and successful freelance portrait sketcher, I know what I&amp;#39;m doing. I can tell you what to look for with the emphasis on drawing men, so that you understand the world of realistic pencil sketching better and achieve wild results. In a step-by-step process, you will learn about little tricks that make it easier to draw what you see on a photograph. You will also learn:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When to use an HB or a 3B pencil, or in other words, a light or dark pencil.&lt;br /&gt;
The best way to smudge, draw hair, and make a portrait stand out.&lt;br /&gt;
Contrasts, shades, mouths, eyes, and noses, some of the most challenging parts of drawing a portrait.&lt;br /&gt;
The difference between easy shadows and complicated ones, and how to identify areas.&lt;br /&gt;
Fun and smart ways to create beautiful horse hair, eyes, noses, and ears that resemble reality.&lt;br /&gt;
And much more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A pencil sketch of a handsome man, a loved one, or a kid can create great memories and make someone&amp;rsquo;s day. You could make money doing it or surprise someone with a gift. You can frame your drawings, show them off, or just keep them in a drawer as part of your portfolio. Learning to draw anything can be so fulfilling! It&amp;rsquo;s as if you conquer the world in a mysterious way, since you can draw whatever you see. Nothing will be too hard. So learn more how to do it now. Take the shortcut." />
