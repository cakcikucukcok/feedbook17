 THE DIAGNOSIS
    One month before Anthony turned three years of age we finally got a diagnosis.   Autism!  Anthony was given this diagnosis by displaying the following symptoms: 
1.	No imaginative or social play.
2.	Impaired ability to make friends with peers.
3.	Inability to have a conversation with others.
4.	Repetitive use of language.
5.	Patterns of interest that was abnormal in intensity or focus.
6.	Inflexible adherence to specific routines or rituals.
7.	Preoccupation with parts of objects.
     Autism is a social disorder that affects every child differently. I am thankful that Anthony was actually diagnosed as high functioning, which meant there was hope for improvement.  Anthony was one and a half to two years delayed in almost everything, was sensory sensitive, and considered hyperactive.  In the beginning, he was hearing sensitive and then later became partially deaf.   He could not stand certain textures on his body or to touch.  It was sometimes difficult to keep clothes on him; he pulled his clothing off several times a day.  He was orally sensitive to the texture of foods and would not eat very many varieties.  He would first smell the food, and then touch it with his tongue before it ever entered his mouth.  He could not eat a lot of food because of its texture.  He only ate a few basic things; including anything with cheese. To this date has to have ranch dressing and or ketchup with any food he eats.  He has never liked or ate snacks like Twinkies, cupcakes, pastries, cake, or cookies. He only likes plain chocolate candy, no taffy or anything chewy or with nuts and he can&#39;t tolerate gum in his mouth. Anthony loves chocolate ice cream with lots of chocolate syrup, but will not eat whip cream on top.
        The first feelings I experienced once we received the diagnosis were mixed. I had already pretty much diagnosed him myself by then.  OK God, now I know what it&#39;s called, but what do I do about it? How do I help him to just be able to cope and make it through one day? I began to read every book I could get my hands on.  I thanked God that my child was not as severe as some of the ones I had read about. Some of the books were both scary and depressing.  Some of the children I read about ended up being sent to hospitals or special homes because it was too difficult for their families to care for them at home. When my older children and other family members were told of Anthonys diagnosis, it was not really a surprise to anyone.  My family and older children have always been supportive in every way they could, and have always tried to help with Anthony and believed the best for him. 
     The following week I attended a singles group meeting.  This was just where God wanted me to be at this particular time.  Have you ever felt desperate and you went to a church service and it was totally meant for God to minister to you and your problem? God knew exactly where I was and He met me there.  I entered that room that night quite overwhelmed and discouraged.  I needed something from God.  I was a single mother trying to face all of this alone. There is no known cure for Autism and the doctors don&#39;t even know what causes it or prevents it.  As I sat there and listened to the minister God spoke to my heart.  This minister was telling a story that had taken place some years ago.  His son had been in the hospital very ill.  Although he was only an infant he was struggling just to stay alive.  They were given a diagnosis and told what to expect.  This man turned to God on behalf of his son.  He put his total faith in God and then reminded God, what His Word says. I Peter 2:24 says Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we dead to sins should live to righteousness by whose stripes we were healed. (KJV) Anything less than a perfectly normal child was unacceptable to him. 
     Those words stuck in my mind through the difficult and hard years to come.  At that moment I also c" />
