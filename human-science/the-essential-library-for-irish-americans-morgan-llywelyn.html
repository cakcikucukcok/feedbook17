  <title>The Essential Library For Irish-Americans - Morgan Llywelyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ireland is in the news and a center of international attention in this decade. This book is an instructive, opinionated, annotated list of books that anyone in America who is Irish or interested in the Irish ought to read. Morgan Llywelyn has chosen these books for their accuracy and their pleasures, and describes them in clear, concise language that is in itself a pleasure. It does not summarize the contents but rather tells you what experiences are in store for ther reader of each individual book listed. The books are listed in broad categories, such as biography and autobiography, history, poetry, fiction, and many more. This guide will be a useful companion to travellers to Ireland, will give insight into the Irish heritage of Irish Americans, will be a guide to further reading, and perhaps even to building family libraries in the home. Morgan Llywelyn, the author of fine novels of the past of Ireland, such as Lion of Ireland, and the present, such as 1916, has both the knowledge and the credibility to present this book to the reading public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
