  <title>Integration and Growth - Prof. Dr. Ceylan Das</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gestalt approach is both a life philosophy and a therapy school. The Gestalt approach, with its humanistic point of view, gives the opportunity to the person to be aware of himself or herself and those around him or her to integrate both within himself or herself and with the world without judging or accusing, without feeling ashamed, scared, or worried, and to exist as fully grown in the way he or she really is. 
This book is written with two important goals in mind. One of the aims of the book is to introduce the Gestalt therapy approach and, while introducing it, to help the readers to be aware of their needs, wishes, the styles of contact they use in their relations, their unfinished businesses, their impasses, and their resistance to change. The second purpose of the book is to help those therapists in therapy training by presenting the theory and methods of the Gestalt approach with examples, and thus contribute to the raising of their therapeutic knowledge and skill levels." />
