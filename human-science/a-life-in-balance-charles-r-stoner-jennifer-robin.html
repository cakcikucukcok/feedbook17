  <title>A Life in Balance - Charles R. Stoner, Jennifer Robin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you working more but enjoying it less? Are you searching for greater fulfillment, significance, and meaning? Are you simply looking for a better sense of balance in your life? If you have identified with any of these statements you are not alone. Many of us experience an absence of personal significance in our lives; we have a sense that something is &quot;horribly out of whack.&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But, there is hope. We can have successful, rewarding careers and still experience richly textured, fulfilled personal lives. This work examines the confusion and myth of life balance, offers a new paradigm of balance, and illuminates a path for busy professionals and managers to follow to achieve real balance and deeper meaning in their lives. Drawing from business theory, existing and original research, and the authors&#39; own consulting experiences, A Life in Balance is an engaging, thoughtful, and readable guide that will help readers unfold and create their own balance experience." />
