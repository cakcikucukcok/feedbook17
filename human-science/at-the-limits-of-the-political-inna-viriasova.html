  <title>At the Limits of the Political - Inna Viriasova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The question of the limits of the political permeates the history of western political thought and has been at the forefront of debates in contemporary political philosophy, especially in French and Italian contexts. This book argues that the question of radical political exteriority fell into neglect despite post-War critiques of totalitarian political ontology. The notion of &amp;lsquo;the political&amp;rsquo; developed into a new form of totality, one which admits the impossibility of closure and yet refuses to let go of its totalizing ambition. Inna Viriasova addresses this problem by offering a critical introduction to the debate on the concept of the political in contemporary continental philosophy, and develops an innovative perspective that allows us to rethink the limits of the political in affirmative and realist terms. The book explores such recent developments as Roberto Esposito&amp;rsquo;s notion of the impolitical, Giorgio Agamben&amp;rsquo;s concept of bare life, Michel Henry&amp;rsquo;s radical phenomenology of life, the speculative realist philosophy of Quentin Meillassoux, as well as Buddhist political thought. The book makes a vital contribution to an emerging body of literature in contemporary philosophy that renews the fundamental questions of political ontology in response to the multiplying crises of inclusion that challenge democratic communities today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
