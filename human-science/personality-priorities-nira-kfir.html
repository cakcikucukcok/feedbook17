  <title>Personality &amp; Priorities - Nira Kfir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Personality &amp; Priorities, &quot;Impasses&quot; are roadblocks that evolve in early childhood and impede or limit the child&#39;s social development and movement in life. Impasses develop out of a coalescence of unpleasant or painful interpersonal experiences in early life that signify non significance and non belonging to the child.
The four priorities are present in everyone&#39;s behavioral repertoire in varying degrees. However, one of the priorities is pre-eminent, and the others are subordinated to it. They help therapists understand clients quickly, and allow them to aid clients in reaching self-understanding and self-acceptance and in recognizing the price they pay for their chosen priority and behavioral strategies.
Dr. Nira Kfir, PhD is a psychotherapist and Director of Maagalim  Institute for Psychotherapy and Counseling in Tel Aviv, Israel. 
Her theory of personality and priorities has developed into an innovative psychotherapeutic diagnostic system  Personality Impasse/Priority Therapy, which is used internationally.
Her theoretical model of Crisis Intervention is presented in her book, Crisis Intervention Verbatim." />
