  <title>Henrik Ibsen: Poet, Playwright and Psychologist - Mark H. Stone, Cheryl A. Wagner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book presents important psychological matters occupying Ibsen&#39;s life including his observations that were transformed into poems and plays. Attention is given to Ibsen&#39;s insight into psychological issues pre-dating the ideas as presented in the psychoanalytic writings of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler. Freud and Adler acknowledged Ibsen&#39;s psychological insight, but Ibsen&#39;s insight into human nature is still not fully recognized. This book addresses that neglect. Ibsen utilized his own life experiences together with a careful observation of human behavior to present what later became immensely important to the yet undeveloped field of psychoanalysis. Special attention is given to Ibsen&#39;s simple but important understanding of therapeutic change and decision-making." />
