  <title>Revolution of the Heart - Michel Leroux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you were to travel the world, you would quickly come to realize that the vast majority of humanity has the same list of wants and needs: food, shelter, water, education, justice and safety, to name a few. Joys and sorrows, hopes and desperations are also similar in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it sometimes justifies our personal paradigm to believe differently, &lt;strong&gt;WE ARE ALL FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME&lt;/strong&gt;. If at the core we are all the same, why then is it that we collectively are having such a hard time? Essentially, this last question is where the inspiration for this book comes from. The content of the book comes from the authors decades of research, observations and experiences gained while living and working in more than nine different countries, visiting over sixty countries spread on six continents. A love, a passion and ultimately, a belief that humanity has the power to choose to create a better life for all is the driving force behind this exploration of human suffering and how to ultimately rise above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This need for a better life for all has never been as apparent as it is now. Our collective denial of the reality of suffering is being confronted. We are starting to realize that there is no choice but to deal with it: problems are not going away but rather, they seem to be multiplying exponentially. Perhaps we live in times where it has become luxurious thinking to believe that someone else will fix the environment, the economy, social injustices, international conflicts, human trafficking, or poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for greatness on a mass level to be expressed. This book is meant to appeal to the heart more than the mind. The expression analyzing something to death couldnt be more appropriate than now. All potential progress seems to be continuously stalled with the belief that there is a need to generate more data to really understand the problems. Will we die as a species because of our minds obsession for analysis or will our hearts see through the smoke of insanity, put out the fires so that at some point, hopefully sooner than later, the mind will be able to see clearly through its confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the question is how will we individually and collectively deal with the problems currently facing humanity? This question is essentially addressed to the vast majority of humanity as most are suffering from the excessive greed that has swept the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless ways one can contribute to the betterment of the world. It always starts with people taking one small step to make a difference. It starts with YOU! Never underestimate the power that one person has to change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the book is threefold:&lt;/p&gt;
to bring about an awareness of the current situation on the planet so that people can start to question their current paradigm and see how they feed into the problems rather than help solve them; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
to encourage a new level of personal responsibility that is necessary in any time of change or crisis; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
and provide information and tools to help in the transformational process by empowering people.
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
Part 1: Its All About Me, Isnt It?  The Individual
Part 2: What About the Others?  The Collective
Part 3: Together  The Individual and the Collective
&lt;p&gt;Each part has a different number of chapters. The general book outline follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foreword: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This part introduces why the book was written. The foreword sets the stage for what is to come in the book and encourages the reader to read right through as some chapters are more challenging than others and that the solutions proposed are spread throughout the book.
