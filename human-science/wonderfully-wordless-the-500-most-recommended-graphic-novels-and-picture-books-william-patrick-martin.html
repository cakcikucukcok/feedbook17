  <title>Wonderfully Wordless: The 500 Most Recommended Graphic Novels and Picture Books - William Patrick Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Wonderfully Wordless: The 500 Most Recommended Graphic Novels and Picture Books &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is the first comprehensive best book guide to wordless picture books (and nearly wordless picture books). It is an indispensable resource for parents and teachers who love graphic storytelling or who recognize the value of these exceptional books in working with different types of students, particularly preschool, English as a Second Language (ESL), and special needs, and creative writers. Every age group will benefit from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Wonderfully Wordless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, from babies and toddlers encountering their first books, to elementary age children captivated by the popular fantasy and adventure themes, to teenagers attracted to graphic novels because of their more intense content and comic book format. Even adults who are not yet readers will benefit from this uniquely authoritative resource because it will provide a bridge to literacy and give them books that they can immediately share with their children. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 500 books included here are generated from a database with 7,300 booklist entries. In essence, the ranked list emerging from this compilation will constitute &amp;ldquo;votes&amp;rdquo; for the most popular titles, the ones most experts agree are the best. By pooling the expertise from the US and other English-speaking countries, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Wonderfully Wordless &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is an unrivaled core list of classic and contemporary titles. This authoritative reference book conveys not the opinion of one expert, but the combined opinions of a legion of experts. If a single picture is worth a thousand words, then a multitude of the picture-only texts is worth a compendium. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
