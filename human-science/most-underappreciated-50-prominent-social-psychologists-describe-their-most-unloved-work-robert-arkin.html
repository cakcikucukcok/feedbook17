  <title>Most Underappreciated: 50 Prominent Social Psychologists Describe Their Most Unloved Work - Robert Arkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fifty of todays most prominent social psychologists describe their scholarship, focusing on the human and personal side of the life of the mind. Each author spotlights his or her least appreciated work, and discusses theory, methods, findings, or application. The contributors also use this opportunity to provide the context behind their work. Some authors describe their mentors, the influential figures who led them to certain areas of research. Others offer advice to young researchers who are just entering the field and who can learn from their predecessors mistakes and miscalculations.  These contributors address issues like how to prepare for, and make the most of, a professorship in a liberal arts college context, and how to frame a research question, title an article, handle a controversy, pursue a passion, devise a method, think about a meta-analysis, and write persuasively.  Still others discuss what makes their research important to them and to the field, describing the impact of their work on their own future research agendas.    In fifty engaging and succinct essays, these eminent psychologists pull back the curtain on their professional lives.  Their stories are personal and touch on relationships, passion for ideas, and the emotional highs and lows of academic life. This book is a truly unique glimpse behind scenes of social psychology and the people who have advanced the field." />
