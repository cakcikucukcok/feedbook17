  <title>An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense - Francis Hutcheson, Aaron Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Francis Hutcheson answers the criticism that had been leveled against his first book &lt;EM&gt;Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue&lt;/EM&gt; (1725). Together the two works constitute the great innovation in philosophy for which Hutcheson is most well known.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; The first half of the &lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Essay&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt; presents a rich moral psychology built on a theory of the passions and an account of motivation, deepening and augmenting the doctrine of moral sense developed in the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Inquiry&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;. The second half of the work, the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Illustrations,&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; is a brilliant attack on rationalist moral theories and is the font of many of the arguments taken up by Hume and used to this day.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; As editor Aaron Garrett notes, &amp;#8220;In the &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Essay&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; Hutcheson provides his crucial argument against Hobbes and Mandeville, that not just egoistic self-preservation, but also benevolence, is an essential feature of human nature.&amp;#8221;&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; Professor Garrett has constructed a critical variorum edition of this great work. Because there are no manuscripts of the work, this could be done only by comparing all extant lifetime editions. Three such editions exist: those of 1728, 1730 (chiefly a reprint of the 1728 edition), and 1742. The Liberty Fund edition collates the first edition with Hutcheson&amp;#8217;s revision of 1742.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Francis Hutcheson&lt;/STRONG&gt; was a crucial link between the continental European natural law tradition and the emerging Scottish Enlightenment. Hence, he is a pivotal figure in the Natural Law and Enlightenment Classics series. A contemporary of Lord Kames and George Turnbull, an acquaintance of David Hume, and the teacher of Adam Smith, Hutcheson was arguably the leading figure in making Scotland distinctive within the general European Enlightenment.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Aaron Garrett&lt;/STRONG&gt; is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Boston University.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;Knud Haakonssen&lt;/STRONG&gt; is Professor of Intellectual History and Director of the Centre for Intellectual History at the University of Sussex, England. &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
