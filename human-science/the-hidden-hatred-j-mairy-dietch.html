  <title>The Hidden Hatred - J. Mairy Dietch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two peaceful African parents discover the hardest way that four of their five children are homosexuals. A dreadful and devastating storm in their social environment that sweeps everything away and leaves Jean-Nol, their last son, filled with a hatred beyond words. For this barely twenty-year-old boy, the responsible cause of his family tragedy can only be the mass media. 
He thinks he has managed to overcome the feelings that poisoned his existence when an ultimate representative of the abhorred professional category crosses his road: Jean-Nol has become a tour guide in a renowned natural reserve, and Rocky Butten, a famous Hollywood filmmaker, travels to Africa for the very first time in his life, supposedly for vacation. 
The Hidden Hatred is the story of a phenomenon that appears to be universalhow social pressure, combined with the perception of traditional values, can lead a young man to the extreme. 
From Jean-Nols saga, one equally universal assessment can be made: whatever the place in the world and whatever the topic, the human psyche is suggestible, fluctuating, and totally out of controljust a loose cannon." />
