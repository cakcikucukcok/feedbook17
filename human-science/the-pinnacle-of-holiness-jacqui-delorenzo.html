  <title>The Pinnacle of Holiness - Jacqui DeLorenzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;What Good Thing Must I Do to Enter Into Eternal Life?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Almost 2,000 years ago, a rich younger ruler asked the Messiah this question. Messiah&#39;s response was revolutionary. He simply commanded the young ruler to go onto perfection. This verse and countless others prove this statement - perfection is the only manner in which we will enter into eternal life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;From this reality evolves 2 central questions:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;1. What does it mean to be perfect?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;2. How do we achieve perfection?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Quite simply, perfection is measured by our success at executing the will of the Father. We are only able to do so by first achieving holiness. By analyzing the 16 primary degrees of holiness, we will understand every facet of perfection, as well as deduce the correlation between all the principle components of scriptural theology. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;For example, what are your views on sin? Do you know that sinners can not inherit eternal life? Do you know that the Holy Spirit gives us power to make a clean break from both sin and our sinful nature?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Furthermore, have you ever considered the lack of miracles, healing, signs, and wonders in our world? The Gospel is filled with them, although only a handful of believers wrought these works. As for us, we have millions of believers worldwide and still aren&#39;t doing a fraction of their works.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Needless to say, the church circuit is filled with many spiritual deficits that will only begin to be resolved when each member fulfills the Greater Commission and goes on to perfection. In this book, I will address many of these deficits and show how they are only resolved by holiness. By the end of it, you will be prepared to set your foot upon the path to perfection and become heir to eternal life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
