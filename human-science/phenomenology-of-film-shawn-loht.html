  <title>Phenomenology of Film - Shawn Loht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book uses the philosophy of Martin Heidegger as a framework for addressing key issues in the philosophy of film. It is the first single-author monograph that takes up Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s relevance to film. It will be of particular interest to philosophers of film and specialists of film and media studies working in the intersection of phenomenology and film or phenomenological approaches to issues in popular culture. Principal topics addressed in this work include the ontology of film and moving images; the phenomenological character of the viewer experience; film conceived as an art medium; and the function of films as vehicles for philosophical thought. Also of emphasis is the question of how to reconcile film as a popular entertainment medium with Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s own various critiques of popular media and culture throughout his career. Important concepts from Heidegger&amp;rsquo;s philosophy that are discussed include Dasein, existentiality, world, art and poetry, and the nature of philosophy. The first four chapters take up these issues from a theoretical perspective. The remaining chapters provide robust application of the theoretical material to the films of three contemporary filmmakers: Terrence Malick, Michael Haneke, and David Gordon Green.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
