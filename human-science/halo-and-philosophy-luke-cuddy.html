  <title>Halo and Philosophy - Luke Cuddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Since the &lt;I&gt;Doom&lt;/I&gt; series, First Person Shooter (FPS) videogames have ricocheted through the gaming community, often reaching outside that community to the wider public. While critics primarily lampoon FPSs for their aggressiveness and on-screen violence, gamers see something else. &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; is one of the greatest, most successful FPSs ever to grace the world of gaming. Although &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; is a FPS, it has a science-fiction storyline that draws from previous award-winning science fiction literature. It employs a game mechanic that limits the amount of weapons a player can carry to two, and a multiplayer element that has spawned websites like Red vs. Blue and games within the game created by players themselves.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8217;s unique and extraordinary features raise serious questions. Are campers really doing anything wrong? Does &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8217;s music match the experience of the gamer? Would Plato have used &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; to train citizens to live an ethical life? What sort of Artificial Intelligence exists in &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; and how is it used? Can the player&amp;#8217;s experience of war tell us anything about actual war? Is there meaning to Master Chief&amp;#8217;s rough existence? How does it affect the player&amp;#8217;s ego if she identifies too strongly with an aggressive character like Master Chief? Is &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; really science fiction? Can &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; be used for enlightenment-oriented thinking in the Buddhist sense? Does &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt;&#39;s weapon limitation actually contribute to the depth of the gameplay? When we willingly play &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; only to die again and again, are we engaging in some sort of self-injurious behavior? What is expansive gameplay and how can it be informed by the philosophy of Michel Foucault? In what way does &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8217;s post-apocalyptic paradigm force gamers to see themselves as agents of divine deliverance? What can Red vs. Blue teach us about personal identity?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These questions are tackled by writers who are both &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; cognoscenti and active philosophers, with a foreword by renowned &lt;I&gt;Halo&lt;/I&gt; fiction author Fred Van Lente and an afterword by leading games scholar and artist Roger Ngim.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
