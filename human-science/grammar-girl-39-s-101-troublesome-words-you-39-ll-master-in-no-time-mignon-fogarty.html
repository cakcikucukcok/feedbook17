Now she&#39;s turning her attention to solving your worst problems--one troublesome word at a time.&lt;br&gt;Are you feeling &quot;all right&quot; or &quot;alright&quot;? Does &quot;biweekly&quot; mean twice a week or every two weeks? Do you run a gauntlet or a gantlet? Is a pair of twins four people or two? &lt;br&gt;The English language is always changing, and that means we are left with words and phrases that are only sort of wrong (or worse, have different definitions depending on where you look them up).
