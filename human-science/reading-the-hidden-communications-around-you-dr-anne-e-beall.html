  <title>Reading the Hidden Communications Around You - Dr. Anne E. Beall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How well do you read the body language of the people around you? Researchers estimate that nonverbal communication comprises between 60 and 93 percent of all communication. How much are you missing? In &lt;i&gt;Reading Hidden Communications Around You&lt;/i&gt;, author Anne Beall shares her approach to reading individuals in the workplace.&lt;p&gt;
Beall describes an easy, intuitive way to interpret body language called PERCEIVE, a technique Beall developed after an exhaustive review of relevant academic studies conducted in the fields of psychology, anthropology, and communication. PERCEIVE can be used to identify receptivity, like, dislike, discomfort, stress, deception and emotions. It can also be used for impression management to increase perceptions of credibility, trustworthiness and likeability in the workplace. Beall provides insight into the major aspects of nonverbal communication, including facial expressions, physical contact, eyes, gestures and voice, as well as proximity and relative orientation, which are the foundation of body language.&lt;p&gt;
With real-life examples and photos, &lt;i&gt;Reading Hidden Communications Around You&lt;/i&gt; helps you observe nonverbal behavior, use the PERCEIVE method to read peoples reactions and emotions, and present an appropriate response for each situation." />
