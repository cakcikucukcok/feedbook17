  <title>7 Sexes &amp; the Origin of Man - Sri Sunkara Sankacharya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sri Sanyassian Sunkara Sankacharya&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Amazing, shocking, overwhelming, fascinating, intriguing. Concepts which have eluded clear expression for thousands of years. Where did the race originate? Why are we here? Does Human personality survive the Death of the Body? Where will we be after Death? What is the purpose of the life experience? What to believe? Who has the Truth? Where is the evidence? What is the Correct Philosophy? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
7 Sexes is not for the timid, or the easily offended. It is not the intent to give offence, however the contents are outside of ones Educational experience, beyond Orthodox, Institutional Teachings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Biblical Saviour taught, Seek the Truth, Mahatma Ghandi taught, Hang on to Truth, Sri Sunkara, Spiritual Philosopher of the age delivers, Herein the Truth to set you Free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The controversial author of VEDANTA  Bhagavad- Gita 2000 and ASK  Were you there? asked
The Tree of Knowledge, How did It start? The Spirit in the Tree responded: Out of Africa they say. Nay! Nay, Nay, Tree does sway. Long afore, before any Country, world or Galaxy were; Far Beyond the Physical you will find Humanitys Self-starter. Science, State &amp; Religion, Restrict belief, leading to Disaster; Empowering, Feeding Confusions Charter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Todays Belief Systems offer several choices, none of which withstand the scrutiny of time. The youth
are offered a God a Supreme Male Being, Darwins theory of Evolution from an Ape, a Science of Big
Bang from a Black Hole or an end to physical Life leading to Nothingness. Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, internationally acclaimed Medium/Theosopher wrote 1,550 pages in a Doctrine, representing over 632,000 words. The dreaded word, SEX, appears three times. If mankind is not a race immersed in sexuality, then what is it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Knowledge of the complexities of the Spiritual Rounds, Rings, Chains and Sub races will not make the AIDS virus go away, nor solve the personal problems of the potential Suicide, nor bring you who read these words enlightenment or happiness. Sri Sunkara provides indisputable Evidence to support the Spiritual Reality of Existence; an intelligent fact based cosmic sense alternative to the Status Quo. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now Revealed to the outer world; the Hidden history of the ancient race of human Species. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Be Free; armed with Perennial Wisdom, loaded with Truth, an exciting path for mans exploration &amp;
discovery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sunkara has no side agenda, no mortal ally, holds no specific group in awe, not affiliated with anyone, no
vested interests to please; Spirit speaks directly to issues which affect us all; truthfully, candidly, where
none have dared to tread.
