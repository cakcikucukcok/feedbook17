  <title>Mind-Society - Paul Thagard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How do minds make societies, and how do societies change? Contemporary social science is oddly incompetent to explain transformations in practices and norms. Many economists and political scientists still assume that individuals make rational choices, despite the abundance of evidence that people frequently succumb to thinking errors such as motivated inference. Much of sociology and anthropology is taken over with postmodernist assumptions that everything is constructed on the basis of social relations such as power, with no inkling that these relations are mediated by how people think about each other.
Paul Thagard systematically connects neural and psychological explanations of mind with social phenomena, covering major social sciences (social psychology, sociology, politics, economics, anthropology, and history) and professions (medicine, law, education, engineering, and business).
The book displays the interdependence of the cognitive and social sciences by describing the interconnections among mental and social mechanisms, which interact to generate social changes ranging from marriage patterns to wars. The major tool for this description is the method of the &lt;em&gt;social cognitive-emotional workup&lt;/em&gt;, which connects the mental mechanisms operating in individuals with social mechanisms operating in groups.
Social change is the result of emergence from interacting social and mental mechanisms, which include the neural and molecular processes that make minds capable of thinking. Validation of hypotheses about multilevel emergence requires detailed studies of important social changes, from norms about romantic relationships to economic practices, political institutions, religious customs, and international relations.
This book belongs to a trio that includes &lt;em&gt;Brain-Mind: From Neurons to Consciousness and Creativity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Natural Philosophy: From Social Brains to Knowledge, Reality, Morality, and Beauty&lt;/em&gt;.   They can be read independently, but together they make up a &lt;em&gt;Treatise on Mind and Society&lt;/em&gt; that provides a unified and comprehensive treatment of the cognitive sciences, social sciences, professions, and humanities." />
