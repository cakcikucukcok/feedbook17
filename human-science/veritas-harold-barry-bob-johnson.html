  <title>Veritas - Harold Barry, Bob Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this metaphysical treatise, physician Dr Harold Barry&amp;nbsp;attempts to interpret reality and life and our place in the universe and how we perceive ourselves. He believes that while science endeavours to understand the function of matter, life itself has never really been successfully included in the exploration and explanation of the whole evolutionary process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Barry believes that nobody&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;has yet equated our brain development with the energy system of the universe to show how we got to be who we are and why we do the things we do. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Veritas,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;he explores and and explains a new paradigm to understand the behaviour of the transmission of energy through all life forms from the beginning of life to the present day and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says: &amp;ldquo;I am pursuing the &amp;lsquo;theory of everything&amp;rsquo; as expressed in life &amp;ndash; I am on a search for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;absolute truth&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Neither science nor philosophy, separately or together, have achieved the goal of understanding reality or absolute truth &amp;ndash; which is simply the inevitable path of energy down the line of least resistance. The answer to our challenge lies all around us and within us. Truth is What IS. Can we comprehend this and accept it?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harold Barry M.B., B.S., M.R.C.P.

He graduated in medicine from the University of Queensland, Brisbane, in 1965 and became a Resident and Registrar at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. He later did specialising studies in endocrine and metabolic disease at Hammersmith Hospital, London, and was invited to become a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.
