  <title>Trust in Social Dilemmas - Paul A.M. Van Lange, Bettina Rockenbach, Toshio Yamagishi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the key scientific challenges is the puzzle of human cooperation. Why do people cooperate with one another? What causes individuals to lend a helping hand to a stranger, even if it comes at a major cost to their own well-being? Why do people severely punish those who violate social norms and undermine the collective interest? Edited by Paul A.M. Van Lange, Bettina Rockenbach, and Toshio Yamagishi, &lt;em&gt;Trust in Social Dilemmas&lt;/em&gt; carefully considers the role of trust in establishing, promoting, and maintaining overall human cooperation.
By exploring the impact of trust and effective cooperation on relationships, organizations, and communities, &lt;em&gt;Trust in Social Dilemmas&lt;/em&gt; draws inspiration from the fact that social dilemmas, defined in terms of conflicts between self-interest and the collective interest, are omnipresent in today&#39;s society. In capturing the breadth and relevance of trust to social dilemmas and human cooperation more generally, this book is structured in three effective parts for readers: the biology and development of trust; the importance of trust for groups and organizations; and how trust factors across the overall health of today&#39;s society.
As Van Lange, Rockenbach, Yamagishi, and their team of expert contributors all explore in this compelling new volume, there is little doubt that trust and cooperation are intimately related in most - if not all - of our social dilemmas." />
