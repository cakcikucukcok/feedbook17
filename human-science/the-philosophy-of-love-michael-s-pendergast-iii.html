  <title>The Philosophy of Love - Michael S. Pendergast Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With a history that of open marriages, staggering divorce rates, single parent homes, shacking up with significant others and living together, and often troubled blended families, it seems that the option of a happy, life-long marriage no longer exists in todays secularized, feminized world of radical individualism.&lt;p&gt;
Yet hidden under this shabby veneer, most persons still long for something, still desire real meaning, still feel the pull towards permanence - a romantic ideal to be completed. It just wont go away. This ideal - real marriage - survives as a dream, though this joyful state cannot be found in any of the alternatives available from a secular world thats devoid of absolutes and allows any unhappy permutation.&lt;p&gt;
Is there any hope?&lt;p&gt;
There is! But it doesnt lie in constantly trying to redefine marriage (and consistently failing to make anyones life better). It lies in returning to what Sacred Marriage was always meant to be - a sacrament of Life. That, however, can only be found if we return to being what we ourselves were always meant to be: spiritual beings that are larger than the material world and actually grasp what it means to love - and risk loving.&lt;p&gt;
Want to know how? Look inside." />
