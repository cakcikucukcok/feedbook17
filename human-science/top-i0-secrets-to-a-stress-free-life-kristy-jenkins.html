&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make a life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it my response that decides whether a crisis will be escalated or de-escalated and a person humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse, if we treat them as they ought to be, we help them become capable of becoming.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Goethe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our thoughts are powerful. They create our realities. If, each morning we wake up, we start thinking of how our day can mess up, well, it really can be quite a hula boo. And that is just one manifestation of how thoughts can affect our lives. Now imagine, what if we choose to be positive on a daily basis? How different can our lives be? How manageable can stress get, if we choose to see the positive side of things, or if we know/learn how to shift gears? Anxiety, anger, frustration can magically turn to happiness, creativity and success if we are willing to try and learn how.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Top I0 Secrets to a Stress-Free Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is a lifestyle that brings about change &amp;ndash; a shift in perspective and a way to handle stress. this report is not saying that you go &amp;ldquo;shamanic&amp;rdquo; and brouhaha about it, what this is trying to explain is that, there will always be circumstances in life that is beyond your control; whether to be angry or depressed about it but indeed it will create unforeseen realities.&lt;br /&gt;
Here we share some point to ponder &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start with one step at a time&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; you cannot turn positive in one day especially if it has become a habit of yours to dwell on the negative. The fact that you are reading this book is already a baby step towards a more positive and less-stressful life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accept the things that you can&amp;rsquo;t change&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; if an alarm clock doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, there is no need to ruin your day. What you need is a change of attitude and a spare battery.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coffee makers are meant to make coffee, not your day &lt;/b&gt;&amp;ndash; learn how not to depend your attitude in a cup of hot mixture. Choose other rituals to start your day that you can have more control of &amp;ndash; like deep breathes or a yoga posture.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep in mind that positive thoughts turn to positive feelings&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; it all starts with how we think, then our emotions follow through. So it can be said that stress starts in the mind. If at the moment a negative thought starts popping its ugly head inside our minds, and we crush it immediately, then it will have no time to travel down towards our hearts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use visualization or imagination that has positives outlooks&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; believe in the possibility that there are a lot of options to choose from aside from your current situation. Act on it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make use of positive words&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; of course, you cannot have a positive attitude with a mouth that is full of negative words to say. Words ground your thoughts. So choose what you spit out carefully. Watch your situation change as you practice choosing positive words.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Calm is a super power these days&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ndash; in a world full of chaos and people rushing to everywhere, being stress-free means choosing not to participate in the chaos of the modern world.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Once a negative thought enters your mind, swat it like you would to a dengue-infested mosquito &amp;ndash; &lt;/b&gt;take control of your life and know what you allow and what you would not allow. Always choose to keep your thoughts positive. Guard it with all your might.&lt;/li&gt;
