  <title>Unstuck - Jane Anne Staw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;None of us is immune to writer&#39;s block. From well-known novelists to students, associates in business and law firms, and even those who struggle to sit down to write personal correspondence or journal entries -- everyone who writes has experienced either brief moments or longer periods when the words simply won&#39;t come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Unstuck&lt;/i&gt;, poet, author and writing coach Jane Anne Staw uncovers the reasons we get blocked - from practical to emotional, and many in between - and offers powerful ways to get writing again. Based on her experiences working with writers as well as her own struggle with writer&#39;s block, Staw provides comfort and encouragement, along with effective strategies for working through this common yet vexing problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topics include: understanding what&#39;s behind the block * handling anxiety and fear * carving out time and space to write * clearing out old beliefs and doubts * techniques to relax and begin * managing your expectations as well as those of family and friends * experimenting with genre, voice, and subject matter * defusing the emotional traps that sabotage progress and success * ending the struggle and regaining confidence and freedom by finding your true voice - and using it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writers of all levels will find solace, support, and help in this book, leading them to an even deeper connection with their work and more productivity on the page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
