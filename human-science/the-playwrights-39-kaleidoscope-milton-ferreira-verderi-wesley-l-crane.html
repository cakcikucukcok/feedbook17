  <title>The Playwrights&#39; Kaleidoscope - Milton Ferreira Verderi, Wesley L. Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Free from the restraints of the structure, convention, and assumptions of realistic drama, these works show us characters with complex proven identities. Theatre in these works is not a slick metaphor for illusion. A theater is the mirror of role-playing and stereotyping gay men experience everyday. It reflects in complex and multinucleate identities of people who have created their affirming persona.
These plays can not solve the problems of heterosexism or AIDS, but it can offer a liberating vision of what it means to be gay. The works and story line is what the playwright wishes to convey on the audience as a whole by helping to cause the audience or reader to be moved with thought provoking means to stir the mind to think about this side of life.
