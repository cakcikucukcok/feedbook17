  <title>I&#39;m Going Around The Bend - Are You, Too? - Mirjam Indermaur &amp; Dr. Denise Hürlimann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the morning, Mirjam Indermaur had given her sons the same stereotypical lecture about the fact that a dishwasher does not empty itself and that shoes do not clear away themselves. A few hours later, her priorities shifted radically. Her husband had been diagnosed with cancer. Mirjam Indermaur&#39;s emotional world was upside down and she knew that she would not be able to get through this fundamental shock without professional help. Having been suffering from exhaustion depression for a long time anyway, she looked for competent psychotherapeutic support. She found this with Denise Hürlimann, a psychotherapist, with whom she felt cared for from the first moment. After the therapy, Mirjam Indermaur developed the idea of ??writing a book about the path the two women had taken together. Once she, the patient, would write, then again Denise Hürlimann, the specialist. This is how - in mutual storytelling - a read-along psychotherapy emerged. A book that not only gives a deep insight into the world of psychotherapy, but also helps to develop strategies for surviving difficult times and even to find laughter again..&lt;br/&gt;" />
