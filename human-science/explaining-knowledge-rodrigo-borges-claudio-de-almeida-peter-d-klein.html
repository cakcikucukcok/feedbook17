  <title>Explaining Knowledge - Rodrigo Borges, Claudio de Almeida, Peter D. Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gettier Problem has shaped most of the fundamental debates in epistemology for more than fifty years. Before Edmund Gettier published his famous 1963 paper, it was generally presumed that knowledge was equivalent to true belief supported by adequate evidence. Gettier presented a powerful challenge to that presumption. This led to the development and refinement of many prominent epistemological theories, for example, defeasibility theories, causal theories,
conclusive-reasons theories, tracking theories, epistemic virtue theories, and knowledge-first theories. The debate about the appropriate use of intuition to provide evidence in all areas of philosophy began as a debate about the epistemic status of the &#39;Gettier intuition&#39;. The differing accounts of
epistemic luck are all rooted in responses to the Gettier Problem. The discussions about the role of false beliefs in the production of knowledge are directly traceable to Gettier&#39;s paper, as are the debates between fallibilists and infallibilists. Indeed, it is fair to say that providing a satisfactory response to the Gettier Problem has become a litmus test of any adequate account of knowledge  even those accounts that hold that the Gettier Problem rests on mistakes of various sorts. This
volume presents a collection of essays by twenty-six experts, including some of the most influential philosophers of our time, on the various issues that arise from Gettier&#39;s challenge to the analysis of knowledge. Explaining Knowledge sets the agenda for future work on the central problem of
epistemology." />
