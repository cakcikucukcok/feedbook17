  <title>Fast-Forwarding with Audiovisual Translation - Jorge Díaz Cintas, Kristijan Nikoli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This edited collection offers a rounded vision of some of the ways in which audiovisual translation (AVT) can be approached from an academic, professional and educational point of view. The studies provide a stimulating and thought-provoking account of some of the most representative themes that are currently being researched in the field of AVT, while also highlighting new directions of potential research from a cognitive perspective. A conscious effort has been made to cover not only cultural and linguistic approaches to traditional domains of AVT (such as dubbing and subtitling), but also to look into lesser known areas of research that are attracting substantial interest from various stakeholders and gradually becoming part of the remit of AVT (including subtitling for the deaf and audio description for the blind). In this respect, the chapters of this book tackle the field of AVT from a plural, comprehensive and up-to-date perspective; speak of a rich and complex academic subject in the making; broaden our existing knowledge on AVT; reflect the many crossroads and junctions it currently faces and outline some of the issues that will become topical in the near future in this fascinating, flourishing discipline.&lt;/p&gt;" />
