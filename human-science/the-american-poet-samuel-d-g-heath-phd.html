  <title>The American Poet - Samuel D. G. Heath, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Awarded an American Legion Scholarship I am also an award winning author and have published numerous articles and books. Having attended several colleges and universities eventually earning my Ph. D. in Human Behavior I hold several life credentials in education earned during many years as an educator together with years spent working in the Aerospace Industry and other occupations. But to call Einsteins famous equation E=MC2 incomplete because it does not account for life and death does seem quite extraordinary, yet these remain the two greatest mysteries they have ever been denying us thus far a theory of everything.&lt;p&gt; 
Something animates life and departs with death, but what this something is not all our science has yet discovered, though things like the Large Hadron Collider may provide needed insight, and it has been in the pursuit of knowledge about these two greatest mysteries that has compelled me into so many varied academic studies and careers attempting to make sense of the world and our place in it and how people think and deal with the issues of life and death philosophically, religiously, and politically. The things I have discovered along the way compelled me to much research and speculation about these mysteries and how they impact our lives, to communicate my thoughts about them to share with others in a daily journal and posted to my website and provided in book format each year. These writings are of importance in an increasingly dangerous world with a most uncertain future due to so much corruption, ineptitude and lack of accountability in our own government as well as that of others, the abject failure of our schools due to the very same things especially the same lack of accountability we find in government, the religious and political hatreds with protracted wars worldwide and little to give hope for world peace I believed my articles about these important enough to publish in book format.&lt;p&gt; 
Some years ago I removed from the greater part of society to live in semi-seclusion alone with my books and thoughts in a quiet part of the Sequoia National Forest devoting myself to contemplation, speculating about many things and committing my thoughts in writing fulltime. As a writer and author given to much introspection and fascinated by human behavior, nature, and our universe it was important to me to simplify my life as much as possible as anyone given to philosophical speculation about many things must. That much of my writing covers some metaphysical thoughts about God, angels and demons, an afterlife and Biblical stories of origins, of prophecies of the End Times and so much more have been absorbing studies as well and I freely share my thoughts about these in this volume." />
