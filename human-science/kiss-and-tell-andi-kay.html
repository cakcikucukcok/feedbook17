  <title>Kiss and Tell - Andi Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book about where to find them,
when to keep them, why to break it off
and how to lose them. Its a book that
tackles such important questions as: How
do you read between the lines to discern
whats true and whats not? Should you
fake orgasm? Is it okay to break up via
voice mail? What if your kids dont like
him? And what should you write in your
on-line ad? &lt;p&gt;
We fervently believe this book will enable
all single women to learn what weve
learned, laugh along with us at our
mistakes and thus have an easier time
charting those uncharted waters on their
way to new relationships.&lt;p&gt;
Mothers and daughters compare notes on
all sorts of things, but few get to compare
notes on the dating scene, let alone write
a mother-daughter dating book together.
We didnt plan things this way. I suddenly
found myself widowed after 19 years of
marriage and my daughter, Andi, became
a divorcee after ten years of marriage. We
both re-emerged as singles at times in our
lives when we least expected to do so.&lt;p&gt;
We discovered over the yearsas we
compared notes, soothed each others
egos, offered encouragement, and
giggled uproariously over some of the
funnier anecdotes our dating experiences
have yieldedthat commiseration was
a learning and healing experience and
most important of allgreat fun. &lt;p&gt;
We decided to broaden the circle and
interview our friendstwo very different
generations of dating womenand we
found we had all reached many similar
conclusions, namely that there are few
problems that cant be rectified, that
women are too hard on themselves
in dealing with men, and that its far
better to laugh than to take these things
too seriously.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Kiss and Tell: Tales by a Mother and
Daughter &lt;/i&gt;is filled with our stories and
newfound wisdom. We look at how children
fit into the dating picture for younger
women. Is it possible to find a man who
not only loves you but also adores your
children? And we look at the discomfort
older women might feel about suddenly
dating again after forty plus years of
marriage. Invaluable dos and donts of
dating are included throughout the book" />
