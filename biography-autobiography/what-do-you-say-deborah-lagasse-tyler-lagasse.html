  <title>What Do You Say? - Deborah Lagasse, Tyler Lagasse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tyler Lagasse began reading and writing at the age of two. His parents were amazed at how smart he was. When he wouldnt talk to them, they were concerned. How could someone so smart not interact with their parents? By the age of four, they had their answer. He was diagnosed with a form of autism. Determined not to give up when faced with the challenge of raising a son with autism, Deb Lagasse looked to find a place to fix her son. What she discovered through this journey was that her son was not broken. He just experienced the world differently compared to most people. Full of insights, struggles, and celebrations, What Do You Say? Autism with Character will enlighten, educate, and, most of all, inspire you to accept the strengths that everyone has and believe in the power to really see those strengths as talents and skills. For the first time, read Tylers journal reflections of what he thinks, believes, and does as his mother reflects on those same experiences from a sometimes completely different point of view." />
