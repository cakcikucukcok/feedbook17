  <title>I Hate to Leave This Beautiful Place - Howard Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some books celebrate the human condition; others commiserate with us. This memoir does both.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Helen Oyeyemi, NPR&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; This spellbinding memoir by the National Book Award&amp;ndash;nominated author of &lt;I&gt;The Bird Artist&lt;/I&gt; begins with a portrait, both harrowing and hilarious, of a midwestern boy&amp;rsquo;s summer working in a bookmobile, under the shadow of his grifter father and the erotic tutelage of his brother&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend. Howard Norman&amp;rsquo;s life story continues in places as far-flung as the Arctic, where he spends part of a decade as a translator of Inuit tales&amp;mdash;including the story of a soapstone carver turned into a goose whose migration-time lament is &amp;ldquo;I hate to leave this beautiful place&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and in his beloved Point Reyes, California, as a student of birds.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Years later, Norman and his wife lend their Washington, DC, home to a poet and her young son, and a subsequent murder-suicide in the house has a profound effect on them. In this &amp;ldquo;unexpectedly arresting&amp;rdquo; memoir, life&amp;rsquo;s unpredictable strangeness is fashioned into a creative and redemptive story (&lt;I&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Norman uses the tight focus of geography to describe five unsettling periods of his life, each separated by time and subtle shifts in his narrative voice.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. The originality of his telling here is as surprising as ever.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;These stories almost seem like tall tales themselves, but Norman renders them with a journalistic attention to detail. Amidst these bizarre experiences, he finds solace through the places he&amp;rsquo;s lived and their quirky inhabitants, human and avian.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
