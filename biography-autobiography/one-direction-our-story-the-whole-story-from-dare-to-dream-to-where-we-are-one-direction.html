        &lt;p&gt;Where We Are, the hotly anticipated official 1D book, now combined for the first time in a single eBook volume with One Direction’s first ever official book, Dare to Dream.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One Direction: Our Story: The Whole Story from Dare to Dream to Where We Are charts the boys’ full story in their own words, from X Factor to global superstardom, their own movie and a 133-date tour. A must-have for all fans that missed out on Dare to Dream the first time round. Includes never-before-seen images exclusive to this eBook.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From teen hopefuls auditioning for The X Factor to award-winning international sensations whose names are on everyone’s lips, no one can dispute that Louis, Liam, Harry, Zayn and Niall have had a phenomenal journey.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Dare to Dream, Harry, Niall, Zayn, Liam and Louis each open up about who they are, where they come from, and the X Factor experience, telling the 1D story up until they became the UK’s biggest boyband. Crammed with photos of the band on and off stage, plus private captured moments, it’s the ultimate account of the first chapter of their journey.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Packed with exclusive beautiful photos, backstage snapshots, hand-written annotations and brand new insights into the boys’ world, Where We Are is a unique book charting the boys’ thoughts and feelings, hopes and dreams, and highs and lows of the last year that no fan’s life is complete without – bringing the 1D story right up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
