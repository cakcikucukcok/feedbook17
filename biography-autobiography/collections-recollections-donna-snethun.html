  <title>Collections &amp; Recollections - Donna Snethun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My raison dtre.
This is a book of my memoirs, but it is more than that. It goes back in time to include stories I have heard since childhood about my forefathers (and mothers). I am grateful that the writing bug has been so strong in the Falla family. I look on whatever writing abilities I have as a gift. To me, it is more than a hobbyits a passion! The histories that were written by Uncle Art Falla in the history books of Kinsella and District (Hoofprints and Homesteading) and of Sedgewick and District (Sedgewick Sentinel) were invaluable in my writing of this book. Picking the brains of family memberssisters, cousins, and Aunt Thordis Taylor have been of enormous assistance. While our memories of any particular incident may not be exactly the same, the sharing and the jogging has made the memories I have come alive.
In 2005, my original book Collections &amp; Recollections: 1st edition was printed. It is a book of memoirs. I have received wonderful feedback on that book and hope that you enjoy this book as much as did the readers of Collections &amp; Recollections: 1st edition. I have lived too interesting a life to not leave this legacy.
It seemed only right to include stories about my childrens paternal ancestors, the Snethuns and the Sathers. After having been married to Andy Snethun for fifty-five years, in many ways, these families seem like my family.
I hope you enjoy following the unique lives of several generations of these pioneer families. I have really tried to write only stories that very few of my readers will be able to say, That happened to me too.
Scattered throughout my memoirs, you will find poetry, all of which are my originals. Sometimes I write poetry like I talknot knowing when to quit! I write poetry as long as the thoughts keep coming. (I try to control myself when I talk so I dont do the same)." />
