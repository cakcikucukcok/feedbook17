  <title>24 Years and 40 Days the Story of Army 1Lt Daniel Hyde - Glenda Hyde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He was never mine to keep. I was entrusted to bear him, raise him, and delight in him for 24 years and 40 days before God called him home. 
This is the sweet, inspiring story of the ordinary and extraordinary life of Daniel Hyde. His mother shares her wonderful journey with her son, and the solemn honesty of the horrific difficulty faced by any parent who loses a child. Filled with memories, but determined to keep his spirit alive without regret, Glenda and her family join those who knew and loved him to celebrate Daniel&#39;s life.
This is my commandment: Love one another, as I have loved you. There is no greater love than this, that a man should lay down his life for his friends.
							John 15: 12,13" />
