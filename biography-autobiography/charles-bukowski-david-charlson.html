  <title>Charles Bukowski - David Charlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charles Bukowski disliked academics, as this academic and readable book points out from page one onward of its introduction, &quot;Charles Bukowski vs. American Ways.&quot;   Begun before Bukowski died in 1994, &lt;i&gt;Charles Bukowski: Autobiographer, Gender Critic, Iconoclast&lt;/i&gt; was the first doctoral dissertation on his prose and poetry up to that date, and it is offered now for fans and academics alike-no more need for black-market sales.
&lt;p&gt;
Chapter One, &quot;Placing Bukowski,&quot; introduces Bukowski&#39;s amazing life and career and relates his work to influential predecessors (primarily Ernest Hemingway and John Fante) and four contemporaries (Raymond Carver, Kurt Vonnegut, Frederick Exley, and Hunter Thompson).
&lt;p&gt;
Chapter Two, &quot;Bukowski Among the Autobiographers,&quot; pursues Bukowski&#39;s comprehensive autobiographical project. Harnessing Timothy Dow Adams&#39; concept of &quot;strategic lying,&quot; the chapter follows Bukowski&#39;s thinly veiled personae through three stages-first through the attention-getting &quot;Dirty Old Man,&quot; then responding to the attention and (re)defining himself, finally culminating in &quot;Henry Chinaski,&quot; the hero of Bukowski&#39;s five autobiographical novels.
&lt;p&gt;
Chapter Three, &quot;Problems of Masculinity: At &#39;Home,&#39; at Work, at Play,&quot; tackles the knee-jerk assessment of Bukowski as just a sexist &quot;Dirty Old Man.&quot;  Michael Kaufman&#39;s &quot;triad of men&#39;s violence&quot; (against women, other men, and themselves) explains the general Bukowski persona as a complicated gender construct.  Bukowski&#39;s Bildungsroman, Ham on Rye, shows Chinaski as victim, practitioner, and critic of male violence, with the last role figuring into his other work too.
&lt;p&gt;
Chapter Four, &quot;Bukowski vs. &#39;Institution Art,&#39;&quot; classifies this challenging author as both populist and avant-garde.  As general postmodern phenomenon, he blends the democratic accessibility of populist writing with the adventurous gesturing of the avant-garde, and the result is direct, daring, truthful, and funny.
&lt;p&gt;
The book&#39;s conclusion, &quot;Summing Up: Giving Bukowski His Due,&quot; predicts that Bukowski will be read far into the 21st century.  Buy his books before you buy this one." />
