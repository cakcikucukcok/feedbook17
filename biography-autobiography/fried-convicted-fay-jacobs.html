  <title>Fried &amp; Convicted - Fay Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the author of four humorous memoirs, activist and comedian Fay Jacobs returns with her newest tall tales, &lt;I&gt;Fried &amp; Convicted, Rehoboth Beach Uncorked&lt;/I&gt;. And, as you&amp;#8217;d expect, It&amp;#8217;s chock-full of Fay&amp;#8217;s signature witty, wise, and often laugh-out-loud commentary about the craziness of contemporary life in the diverse and welcoming resort town of Rehoboth Beach on the Delaware Coast.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This time, though, everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite &amp;#147;Sit-Down Comic&amp;#8221; grapples with the insanity of a high-tech bra, cartoon bladders in prescription advertising, and refusing to act her age . . .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Fried &amp; Convicted&lt;/I&gt; was written over the last few years and culminates with Election Day, 2016. It chronicles the joy of gaining equal marriage rights for same-sex couples, tales of Icelandic lagoons, Provincetown adventures, and much ado about lesbians of a certain age. It tells a few harrowing personal stories, such as Bonnie&amp;#8217;s unnerving medical diagnosis, the time Fay went kayaking with alligators, and how she came up with a public relations scheme to rescue her pal&amp;#8217;s purloined pooch. And through it all, she finds a way to make it provocative, political, occasionally heartwarming, and reliably hilarious.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Featuring Fay&amp;#8217;s latest magazine columns plus new, never before published material, &lt;I&gt;Fried &amp; Convicted&lt;/I&gt; is a pleasure for longtime fans and new readers alike.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Come along for the ride&amp;#151;you&amp;#8217;ll be happy you did!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Fay Jacobs&lt;/B&gt; spent thirty years in Washington, DC working in journalism and public relations. Her latest project is a one-woman show, &lt;I&gt;Aging Gracelessly: 50 Shades of Fay&lt;/I&gt;, which is being performed in theatres around the country. She lives in Rehoboth Beach with her wife of thirty-four years and a Miniature Schnauzer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
