  <title>A Beautiful Life - Peter D&#39;Angelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Beautiful Life recollects my life journey as it unfolded from the glorious days of a young boy enchanted by his Grandfathers stories to the present, where the young boy is now a Grandfather himself. Along the way there have been many wrong turns and a lot of personal pain but somehow, through the healing power of writing and those around me at the time who cared, the passion for life survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book includes many poems written at the time of the experiences, which provide insight into my wellbeing and how I dealt with the situation. These poems I now view as Primary sources and the Spiritual Signposts which directed me forward along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my work as a Teacher of students not born in Australia, features heavily throughout the book. As I provided them with the tools of a new language, they rewarded me with their stories of survival and hope for the future. This interactional process of teaching and learning enriched the lives of everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally you the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am certain that you will see yourself somewhere amongst the pages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
