      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cool! Youre reading the back of my book which means the front caught your eye. Now youre just about ready to open it up and, well, since I still have your attention...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is my first book, a lifetime in the making. And you wont find any fancy reviews by important people written here. What you will see is my invitation especially for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the covers is an eclectic collection of true stories extracted from my life and imaginati on. Its not a how-to book or a dramatic tale of triumph. Its simply thoughts about everyday life that most anyone can relate to yet spend little time putting much thought into. This compilation of short stories wont change your life. But Im pretty sure it will warm your heart, make you smile and make you think; you might even shed a tear or two. And it just might inspire you to tweak your outlook on life just a little bit. That, my friend, is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, steal a few moments for yourself and curl up with &lt;i&gt;Life in Flip Flops&lt;/i&gt;. And if a bon fire with smores breaks out halfway through, then youre right where you need to be. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
