  <title>It&#39;s Full of Sandwiches - Gerald Irwin Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The practice of Medicine and hospital
care has changed drastically in the
sixty three years since doctor Irwin
began his career. Things we know now
were impossible at that time. Hospitals
were run quite differently. We are all
aware of Medicare and the proposed
complicated changes in the coming
medical plans proposed in Congress.
This book will take you back to a more
simple time and give you a look at
how things were sixty plus years ago.
Both sad and funny things happened
in the hospital and in General practice
and are all related in this book." />
