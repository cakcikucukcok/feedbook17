  <title>The Dragon - Kirk E. Shipley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MEMO FROM GOD
	To:  YOU
Date: TODAY
From: GOD: The Boss!!
Subject: YOURSELF
Reference: LIFE
 This is GOD. Today I will be handling all of your problems for you.
 I Love You.
    GOD
P.S. And rememberIf life Happens to deliver a situation
To you, that you cannot handle, do not attempt to handle it
Yourself!! Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to handle) box. I will get to it in My TIME!! All situation will be resolved, but in MY time.
p.s.s.  Once the matter is placed into the box, do not hold on to it by worrying about it. Instead, focus on all the wonderful things that are present in your life.
Now go and have a good day because God Loves You.
I talked with a woman the other about her son that was in Viet Nam and eventually died from inhalation of various gases. She said He couldnt find any reason why we were there. Over a period of time he finally found the answer to his, mine and many others that served in any of the various conflicts around the world since WWII. He requested it be inscribed on his tombstone.  RIP Russ Jarvis WE WERE SAVING THE WORLD FROM GODLESS COMMUNISM." />
