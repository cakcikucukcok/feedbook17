  <title>The Path - Jody Weigel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you ever wanted to walk through the Gospels with a friend and discuss how this pertains to your life, here is the perfect opportunity. Come read about Jesus through the lenses of the twenty-first century and relate to life experiences along the way. If you dont know much about the Bible and dont want to ask, this is the perfect venue for you. There will be some ah ha moments, some Kleenex moments, and some funny moments, all drawn within the boundaries of Christian attitudes. You will find some chapters that are purely personal and some that are almost commentary in character, all pointing to themes of nondenominational doctrine to interest you, inform you, entertain you, and encourage you to go further on your own path. Dear Readers, A good look into a womans life with its ups and downs, and always followed by Scripture that gives each experience a higher meaning. All women can relate with different parts of Jodys memoirs, and combined with insightful Scriptures, we get a comforting reminder of how we are provided for by God in Jesus name. Priscilla Marsh, Laguna Beach, California Dear Readers, I have just begun reading the manuscript for The Path, and what a blessing it is! I have already cried, smiled, nodded, and laughed. Thank you, Jody, for 25 years of friendship! Shirley Newis, Calgary, Alberta&lt;/p&gt;" />
