  <title>What You Make of It - Steve Ambrose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Stephen Ambrose. Im a fifty-eight-year old middle-aged gentleman who is disabled. I have a genetic blood disorder that became pronounced because of a basketball injury. I fell back and hit my head, causing a concussion, triggering a blood clot to form in my brain stem. This bit of abnormal blood activity caused my body to have a lack of coordination. Mainly my speech, vision, and walking were affected. Ive written a book entitled, What You Make of It. This literary piece deals with my situation. 
Presently, Im in a long-term live-in facility located in northern Atlanta. Beforehand, I lived with my mom in a warm maternal cocoon state, where nothing could hurt me. Now back to reality, I have to adjust my potentially selfish personality in digesting the attributes of this facility. This project deals with abiding with a daily schedule. Reading this daily itinerary will give one a more accurate recording of the happenings. The reason why one should feel a fever for this piece is because it offers a different perspective. When an individual works with the disabled, he is force-fed on how a disabled person feels. After reading my literary effort, What You Make of It, one gets how a client views circumstances." />
