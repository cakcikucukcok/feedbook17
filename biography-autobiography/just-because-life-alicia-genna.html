  <title>Just Because Life - Alicia Genna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A person gets to be who they are from lifes experiences. We learn how to balance and overcome trials from experience, but even when its unfamiliar, we still seek the knowledge that we hold. In order to do that you must understand who you are as a whole, where you came from and how you got where you are today. Nothing should ever hold you back and no one should ever have the power to. We are who we are and the best way to be that way is to be confident and proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my childhood was anything but easy, I would not be who I am and where I am today if it were any other way. Same goes with the trials I have endured. All the knowledge I hold, I believe to be wisdom and I wish to share with as many as possible to make their experiences that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a single mother, I feel I have accomplished most of what I have wanted to do, but I still will be out there fighting for more. Nothing is ever easy, but at the end of the day, the feel of success and accomplishment is well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Im going to share with you how I came to be who I am today and what I learned on the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
