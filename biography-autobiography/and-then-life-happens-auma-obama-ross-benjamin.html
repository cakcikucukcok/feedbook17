  <title>And Then Life Happens - Auma Obama, Ross Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A moving account by Auma Obama about her life in Africa and Europe, and her relationship with her brother, Barack Obama.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;While her younger brother Barack grew up in the U.S. and Indonesia, Auma Obama&#39;s childhood played out at the other end of the world in a remote village in Kenya, the birthplace of the siblings&#39; shared father. Barack and Auma met for the first time in the 1980s, and they built a lasting relationship which lead to travels together in Kenya, research into their family history and finally Auma&#39;s support for her brother&#39;s political career and eventual bid for the U.S. presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auma spent sixteen years studying and living in Germany, moved to England for love, and gave birth to a daughter there. The tension between her original and chosen worlds and cultures was a constant challenge, and eventually Auma returned to Africa and worked to support young men and women in shaping their futures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;And Then Life Happens&lt;/i&gt;, her candid and emotional memoir, Auma shares her own story as well as recollections of and experiences with her famous brother, who says about their first encounter: &quot;I hugged her, we looked at each other, and laughed. I knew right then that I loved her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
