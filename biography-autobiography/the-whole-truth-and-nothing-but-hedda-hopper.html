  <title>The Whole Truth and Nothing But - Hedda Hopper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the dawn of the studio system to the decade it all came crashing down, Hedda Hopper was one of the Queens of Hollywood. Although she made her name as a star of the silent screen, she found her calling as a gossip columnist, where she had the ear of the most powerful force in show business: the public. With a readership of 20,000,000 people, Hopper turned nobodies into stars, and brought stars to their knees. And in this sensational memoir, she tells all.
In her career, Hopper crossed some of Hollywood’s biggest bold-faced names, from Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn to Charlie Chaplin and Joseph Cotten, and her feud with rival gossip columnist Louella Parsons became the stuff of legend. In The Whole Truth and Nothing But, we get Hedda’s side of the story—and what a story it is.
Hedda Hopper is portrayed by Judy Davis in the Ryan Murphy TV series Feud about Joan Crawford and Bette Davis." />
