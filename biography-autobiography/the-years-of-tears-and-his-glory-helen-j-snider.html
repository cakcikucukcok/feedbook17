  <title>The Years of Tears and His Glory - Helen J. Snider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My husband and I retired in 1990. In the year that followed we moved tp Grove, Oklahoma. We were so excited. Confidently, we looked forward to the future that held our plans for a new way of life. 
Then, with no warning, on August 5, 1996, while we were sleeping mu husband went to be with Jesus. With his passing, our dreams once filled with warmth and expectations, became transparent ashes for me. The life we had known and shared was over.
In my grief and sorrow the Holy Spirit came. In the early morning hours of September 14, 1996, I awakened knowing there was a presence within the room. I was not affraid. Although I did not hear an audible voice, He comforted me. From those moments with Him a hunger was born within my heart to know Him better. From that day forward, He became the focus of my life and an inner peace began to grow within me.
I invite you to join me and follow the steps of my journey with the Holy Spirit. I believe this book will be a source of healing for those who are experiencing heartache and those who are in spiritual need. I promise you when you give your heart to Jesus, He in return, will then do a greater work in you, and you will reap the rewards of peace, joy and happiness.
