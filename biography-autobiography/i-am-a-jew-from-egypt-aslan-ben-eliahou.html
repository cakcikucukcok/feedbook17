  <title>I Am a Jew from Egypt - Aslan Ben Eliahou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Aslan Ben Eliahou, an Egyptian Jew, looks back at a life full of adventure and challenges in this memoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was born in Cairo in May of 1942, most Egyptians cheered German soldiers as liberators. They had no idea that Adolf Hitler considered Arabs to be barely above animals and that their fate under him would be far worse than under Britain. When Gamel Abdel Nasser helped to overthrow King Farouks regime in 1952, the country was once again thrown into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliahou and his family escaped to Paris and later to the United States, where he found his philosophies and beliefs constantly put to the test.In this inspirational account, Eliahou recalls his life on three continents. He explores how Jews, including his family, ended up in Egypt; how families such as his own adjust to radically different cultures; and how immigrants embrace the ideals of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also shares how he struggled with and overcame addiction. Written in a humorous, straightforward style, &lt;i&gt;I Am a Jew from Egypt&lt;/i&gt; is a story of victories, defeats, redemption, and forgiveness that will captivate your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;" />
