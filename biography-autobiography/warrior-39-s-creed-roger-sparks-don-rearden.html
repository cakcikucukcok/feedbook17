  <title>Warrior&#39;s Creed - Roger Sparks, Don Rearden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The riveting story of how a young boy&#39;s upbringing with outlaw culture and charismatic role models forged him into an elite Marine and a decorated Pararescueman.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Absence of self is my sword&quot; comprises the final line in &quot;The Warrior&#39;s Creed,&quot; a 14th century poem written by an unknown Japanese Samurai, and this is the code Master Sergeant Roger Sparks embodied as a Recon Marine turned Alaskan Pararescueman. A living legend in the military, Sparks first made a name for himself within elite Marine Reconnaissance units. He went on to become an instructor where he trained future Reconnaissance Marines with unorthodox and ancient indigenous warrior techniques. A decade later, the same methods would keep him and others alive, when he hoisted into a maelstrom of violence to rescue an embattled platoon in the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Introduced to a tough code of honor, family, and brotherhood from birth, Roger Sparks rose to become a distinguished instructor in Marine Reconnaissance and a Silver Star recipient as an Alaska Pararescueman. A raw and exhilarating tale of guts, grit, and heart, &lt;i&gt;Warrior&#39;s Creed &lt;/i&gt;recounts the hidden side of special operations training, heroic and heartbreaking Alaskan wilderness rescues, and the surreal and deadly rescues during Operation Bulldog Bite in Afghanistan&#39;s Watapur Valley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This powerful and inspirational story is as much of a self-help book as it is an edge of your seat military memoir. &lt;i&gt;Warrior&#39;s Creed&lt;/i&gt; reveals a motivating and mindful approach to overcoming the odds, facing the impossible, and finding mercy and grace in the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;" />
