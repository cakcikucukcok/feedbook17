  <title>Over the Moat - James Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1992, James Sullivan travels to Vietnam to bicycle from Saigon to Hanoi. He has just finished graduate school and has an assignment to write a magazine story about a country that is still subject to a U.S. trade embargo. But in Hue, the old imperial capital of Vietnam, the planned three-month bike trip takes a detour. Here, in a city spliced by the famed Perfume River and filled with French baroque villas, he finds himself bicycling over a moat to visit a beautiful shop girl who lives amid the ruins of the last imperial dynasty of Vietnam. She falls for him, but there&#39;s a catch. Several other suitors are vying for her hand, and one of them is an official with the city&#39;s police force. &lt;i&gt;Over the Moat&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Sullivan&#39;s efforts to win Thuy&#39;s favor while immersing himself in Vietnamese culture, of kindly insinuating himself in Thuy&#39;s colorful and warm family, and of learning how to create a common language based on love and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;" />
