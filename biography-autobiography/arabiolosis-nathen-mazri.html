      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE MOST SHOCKING REVELATION AND EXPLICIT STORY NEVER BEEN
TOLD BEFORE, UNTILL ONE HAS EXPERIENCED ALL OF WHAT LIES IN
MIDDLE OF THE DESERT.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destiny, a word that we think we always have it figured out for us. How is our path drawn? Do our actions and thoughts shape it? Do our religious beliefs lead it? Does the universal external energy knows what my fate is? Do I really know what I want in life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;EMPOWERING MEMOIR THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR PERECEPTION OF LIFE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Adam Burak and moved from Canada to the kingdom of the Arab world for 12 years of my adolescent life, where hardships stood in queue ravaging me physically and internally leaving nothing but strings of hope and dreams hanging out. As a young ambitious man, I thought I had my future all planned out for me, instead, I never knew I was destined for the unexpected, the unthinkable, and the uncalled for; I guess I was simply a citizen of life tested by fate at every step of the way on how badly I desire life !&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;ALL I WANTED IS TO LIVE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have become like a prisoner but for injustice, like a soldier fighting for my life, and like a survivor thriving out of this underground world. &lt;/p&gt;
