  <title>I’m Not One To Gossip, But… - John McEntee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From an embarrassing encounter with Jim Callaghan (and his impressive member) in the gentlemen’s toilet of the Savoy Hotel to the time he was almost throttled by &lt;i&gt;Angela’s Ashes&lt;/i&gt; author Frank McCourt, John McEntee’s career has been nothing if not colourful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reporting on the IRA terror campaign while a correspondent for the &lt;i&gt;Irish Press&lt;/i&gt;, John soon found his home on London’s gossip circuit. With one ear always on the alert for scandalous remarks and titillating tit-bits of conversation, John was launched into a world of endless cocktail parties, book launches and openings, first as the author of the &lt;i&gt;Mail&lt;/i&gt;’s spiky Wicked Whispers gossip column and then as what turned out to be the last ever William Hickey columnist on the &lt;i&gt;Daily Express&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glamour and celebrity encounters aside, whoever said the job of a gossip columnist was easy has obviously never had to pick up the bill at El Vino after a drunken Kingsley Amis has spent the afternoon working his way through the whisky menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gloriously entertaining and wonderfully indiscreet, John McEntee’s enchanting autobiography is a veritable goldmine of anecdotal gems from one of the true denizens of Fleet Street.&lt;/p&gt;" />
