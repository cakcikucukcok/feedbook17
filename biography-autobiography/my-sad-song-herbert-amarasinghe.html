  <title>My Sad Song - Herbert Amarasinghe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Its better to light a candle than to curse the darkness&lt;/i&gt;, the wise old saying had been on my mind over the years. So finally, I lit the candle by writing my biography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book tells all about a boy born to a middle-class rural family in the British colonial Ceylon. Living in an era of strict cultural taboos and ancient practices his young life was utterly intricate. Torn from the bosom of his family, he departs from his cozy village-home to a faraway school to suffer under sadistic teachers. In a miserable boardinghouse he struggles with nasty bullyboys and battles along with constant homesickness. The family tragedies worsen his misery drowning him in grief and, hence, confusion. Later recovering and developing a great vision of life, takes him out of misery to a successful university career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To begin a new twist of fate, he leaves his motherland to spend a quiet family life in New Zealand. Then his family disappointments take him across the Tasman to Australia. Living here for over a few decades he becomes a helpless victim of numerous adverse life events forcing him to a solitary single life. Now he finds his way to survive the loneliness through his profound determination engaged in generosity. Later when he expedites a romance overseas, the surrounding enemies ruin it resulting in the tragic loss of his great lover, leaving him in deep sorrow. In dismay, with a failed mission overseas, and now aimless, he returns to Australia. Grieving silently and living a low profile, suddenly his health deteriorates leaving a little ray of hope of life. Eventually, he recovers slowly and agonizingly bringing his life back to solitude again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a vivid story written true to his memories in sequel and full of haunting childhood, fomenting adolescence, ghosts of numerous failures and finding ways to survive the great losses, disappointments and loneliness through his determination. Also, interestingly the writer relates his times to important events took place in the outer world during these periods; a kind of a historical account. This is a dramatic life journey of a mans own purpose and meaning of battling along. So, those readers who seek a variety would find this book full of interesting episodes, cultural background and differences in the light of the Westerners eyes. Finally, its a unique presentation and not the norm in traditional book stores." />
