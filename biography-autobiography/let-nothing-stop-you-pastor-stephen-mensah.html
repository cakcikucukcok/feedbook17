  <title>Let  Nothing  Stop You - Pastor Stephen Mensah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After critical analysis of my life, I have come to realise the Lord has been my portion for living. The arm of the Lord is really strong and has saved me, and he is still with me. I have drawn this conclusion due to some awkward situations that befell me and that could have resulted in my untimely death. This is the story of how I became a witch doctor, a boxer, and then a pastor and how it took me two years to travel on foot through Africa to get to Europe to attend Bible college because of my calling from God. I have shared my testimony with some unbelievers who have become new converts in Christ, and the Christians with whom I speak revive their hopes and faith. I love to share my story by speaking on a platform because I am not good at writing. But due to space and time constraints, I have chosen to write it down. Pay attention as I share with you some fascinating moments of my life." />
