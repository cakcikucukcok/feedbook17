  <title>Exoneree - Uriah Courtney, Glenda Faye Mathes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if America&#39;s judicial system, designed to protect the innocent, convicts the wrong man and sends him to prison? Uriah Courtney was incarcerated over eight years--for a crime he did not commit. But God set him free--spiritually and physically--to a new life inside his heart and outside razor wire.   Exoneree relates how badly the judicial system can go wrong, but how intensely a dedicated few seek justice. It depicts God&#39;s protection amid the horrors of incarceration. Although it shows dark depravity, it shines with divine transformation.   A sensitive man who loved the outdoors and his family, Uriah viewed life imprisonment as a death sentence. Yet God worked through this trauma to bring him new life. Uriah&#39;s transparent narrative transcends most jailhouse conversion accounts, as he confesses how becoming a Christian helped him cope in some ways but didn&#39;t solve every problem.   Even after his release and exoneration through God&#39;s providence and the efforts of the California Innocence Project, Uriah faced unexpected challenges. In his warm and personable voice, Uriah describes how focusing on Christ helps him to continue overcoming the bitterness and anger often associated with trauma.  And that&#39;s a story everyone needs to read." />
