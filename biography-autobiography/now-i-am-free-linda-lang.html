  <title>Now I Am Free - Linda Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Linda Langs journey to peace has not been an easy one. In their childhoods, she and her four siblings entered the social welfare system and endured what many would consider to be unbearable circumstances, shunted from orphanage to orphange. In &lt;i&gt;Now I Am Free&lt;/i&gt;, Lang invites you into her long and hard-fought journey for understanding, forgiveness, healing, and hope, as she struggled to create her own identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hers childhood was stolen from her, as she and her siblings experienced what she calls soul enslavement. Candidly and honestly, she describes a life of powerlessness and abuse, of private emotions and painful secrets, and of lies and misconceptions that have haunted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She traces a journey up her personal and intimate ladder of enlightenment and inspiration, as she slowly discovers her own truthempowerment can set you free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her hope is that her story will resonate with others who have survived difficult childhoods as well. She seeks to inspire and empower, to provide the base courage for you to start your own journey of discovery. All it takes to get started is one small step at a time, upwards towards freedom. She encourages you to make the effort to step outside the box, ask questionsand never settle for less than the very best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you have never lived in fear and powerlessness, her story of survival will inspire you to appreciate and strive for your personal truth and empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
