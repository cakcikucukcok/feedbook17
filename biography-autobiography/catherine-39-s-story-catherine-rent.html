  <title>Catherine&#39;s Story - Catherine Rent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is my life story. I am a second sibling and a child of divorced parents. After a lifetime of being silent as a bookkeeper, I decided to return to college. I want to have something to say to show that I exist. I am a person. I have a voice, and I am intelligent. This book is my way of standing up for myselfto say that I went through all these experiences, and this is what it was like. 
I am analyzing my own behavior so that I can change. I want to be happier by achieving goals that are worthwhile, yet I ended up in homelessness. I graduated with a bachelor of arts in psychology, so I have learned writing and thinking skills that are helpful. I want to help others, and I feel that the benefit of my efforts is poured into my book, by comparing my personal dynamics to the Bible story of Cain and Abel and by interpreting the story the Wizard of Oz as a familiar story to us all. I also touch on Freuds psychology of how we build our ego and internalize our parents. 
This should prove provocative reading as we think back on our own family of origin and how we developed into the persons that we are. I am proud to place my name on this book and present it to you, my audience." />
