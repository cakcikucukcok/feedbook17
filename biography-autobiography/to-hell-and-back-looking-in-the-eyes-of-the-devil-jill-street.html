  <title>To Hell and Back: Looking In the Eyes of the Devil - Jill Street</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I, Jill Street, was raised in a loving, Christian home. Needing money at 21, I decided to become a stripper. I ended up mixed up with drugs, alcohol, violence, and even the mafia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book commemorates my life of drug addiction, alcoholism, prostitution, and what it&amp;rsquo;s like to become someone else&amp;rsquo;s property. When I got mixed up with the wrong crowd, I was beaten, abused physically, mentally, and emotionally, and raped. My life was on the line on multiple occasions. At 27, my life changed completely when I was in a car wreck.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After the wreck, I was in a coma. I died, and I went to hell. After looking into the eyes of the devil, God pulled me from hell, and only by God&amp;rsquo;s grace did I survive. I woke up with eight broken ribs, collapsed lungs, chest tubes on both sides of my ribs, broken scapula, and all my hair was shaved off because of a scalp laceration. My husband had left me because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t walk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this hopeless situation, I was able to see the light. I was alive! I had survived, and God loved me and was looking out for me. You can survive anything; you just have to have the will to never give up. Life is too precious to take for granted, so go for your dreams. Nobody can take your dignity and respect away, and sometimes you have to fight like hell to save yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
