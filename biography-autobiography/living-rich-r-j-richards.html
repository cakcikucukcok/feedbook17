  <title>Living Rich - R.J. Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his captivating autobiography, Living Rich, first-time author R. J. Richards testifies to his personal definition of wealth: the love of family and friends, abiding faith, a solid work ethic, self-initiative, and accountability. These traits, reflected in every aspect of his life, have enduring legacies in his children and grandchildren, and continue to resonate in his own everyday experience. Growing up in poverty in Waukesha Wisconsin, the author and those within his circle made the most of each moment, gleaning life lessons from such fundamental responsibilities as knowing right from wrong, treating ones fellow human beings respectfully, and striving to be the very best at each task at hand. Richards self-made, homespun account epitomizes a life dedicated to old-fashioned American values, commitment to country and family. The author took his example from his mother, whose love and encouragement gave him the impetus to reach for his highest self, from his father, whose creativity and ingenuity literally edified the family home, from his siblings, with whom his closeness formed the building blocks of future growth, and from his teachers, who cultivated his natural abilities. Richards commitment to leading his best life culminated when he met his beloved wife, Mary and, upon her passing, in subsequent relationships, which provide sustenance in his present life. Each page of the book demonstrates the authors authentication of the philosophy that life begins nowat any age. As readers journey through the triumphs and tragedies, joys and sorrows of an exemplary life, they learn, by the authors example, the true meaning of being rich." />
