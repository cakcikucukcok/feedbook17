  <title>The Singing Masters - John O&#39;Meara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fascinating... a delight not to be missed. It&#39;s a rare treat indeed to find such an honest, penetrating, wise and thoughtful autobiobiography.&#39; - Eilís Dillon, The Irish Times &#39;A beautifully-written book.&#39; - Benedict Kiely, Sunday Independent &#39;Wonderfully lyrical... and extremely well written. It is haunting and memorable. When you finish it, you can hardly wait for another volume.&#39; - Peter Levi, Irish University Review This essay in autobiography opens in Eyrecourt, east Galway, and describes an early schooling at Rockwell and the experiences of a Jesuit novice at Emo Court, Co. Laois, and Rathfarnham. John O&#39;Meara read classical studies at University College, Dublin, and after a spell of teaching at Clongowes Wood left in 1942 on a travelling studentship to Oxford, where he gained a doctorate three years later. In 1947 he married Odile de Montfort, whom he met in Dublin. The Singing-Masters is written with singular clarity and leaves an abiding impression of Ireland between the wars - the hothouse atmosphere of a diocesan seminary, the lure of the Irish countryside (Eyrecourt in summer, Tullabeg in winter), a fledgling state increasingly dominated by the Church - drawn into perspective by a visit to Lourdes and by the author&#39;s self-questionings. In wartime Oxford, where he met Lutyens, Waugh and Belloc, Dodds and Father D&#39;Arcy, O&#39;Meara comes of spiritual and intellectual age, linking Ireland once more to the traditions of theological Europe, and finding his singing-masters in Augustine, Eriugena and the Neo-Platonists. With this quiet celebration of selfhood, and in its limpid recall of time gone, John O&#39;Meara has created a classic of its kind." />
