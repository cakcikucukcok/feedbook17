  <title>The Child in Me Remembers - Evelyn Morse-Stover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It takes a village to raise a child                                        is an old saying.  The village had a lot to learn  where I was concerned. I was frightened as a child much of the time, made fun of and left in some dangerous situations. Where were the people who were supposed to make me feel secure, protected, and stable?    It only takes a split second of not watching a child for something to occur that could change their life forever.  Take my word for it and read on
I was only four years old when my life took a turn for the worst. 
Too many parents trust family members to watch their children.  You should be able to trust them; however, some of these family members may be children themselves. They are not responsible, and do not give the child the needed attention.  
Any child might have aspirations to become a doctor, lawyer, filmmaker, or President of the United States. It is up to the parents to make sure they are raised up to become well- developed adults. That starts at home, with a secure, loving surrounding.  
This is the story of my childhood.  I am a survivor of my circumstances. I toughed it out and God brought me through it all. Worse has happened to others in this world.  
While reading, though, think about how I rose up each day in spite of it all. You can, too. Just believe you were meant to be somebody special, and stay steadfast to your dreams.   
My story will surprise my family and inspire my readers  inspire them to reach for their passion and not let anything get in their way.  We are beautiful in Gods sight and we need to start acting like it, today.
