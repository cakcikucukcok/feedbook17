  <title>Hidden from the Sun - Jenny Kalsner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jenny Kalsner tells her story with the voice of a young child
coupled with the reflections of an adult. Her memoire is clearly
distinct from that of Ann Frank, in that she was only six when
entering hiding. Jenny&#39;s limitations in hiding from the Nazis were
greater than Anne&#39;s, but they helped her survive. This special story,
told in powerful language, explores the stages of renewed self
confidence and maturation that led Jenny to a life of fulfillment
and satisfaction. Her early experiences are retold with artistic
sensitivity and wisdom.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;Poetically written, with emotion on every page, the
reader is taken from laughter to tears . . . a remarkable
bookit should be required reading.&quot;
