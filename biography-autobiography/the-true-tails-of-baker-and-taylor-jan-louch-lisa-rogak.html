  <title>The True Tails of Baker and Taylor - Jan Louch, Lisa Rogak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not since George Bailey in &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life&lt;/i&gt; has someone so lifted the spirits of an entire community. That the &#39;someone&#39; in this case is, in fact, two library cats makes this true tale of the love of literature combined with a fondness for nose licking all the more magical. This book, like a purring kitten who may also be a genie, should be welcomed into any home.&quot;--Francesco Marciuliano, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;I Could Pee on This: And Other Poems by Cats&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It all started with mice in the library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assistant librarian Jan Louch and a coworker decided that what the library needed was a cat. Or, even better, two cats. Soon, they found a pair of Scottish Folds who were perfect for the job. Jan named them Baker and Taylor, and they took up residence in the library. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But these cats were much more than mousers. Visitors to the library fell in love with Baker and Taylor and their antics just as Jan had. And then, after Jan let the cats be photographed for a poster, they became feline celebrities. Children from across the country wrote them letters, fans traveled from far and wide to meet them, and they became the most famous library cats in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The True Tails of Baker and Taylor, &lt;/i&gt;Jan Louch looks back and tells the remarkable story of these two marvelous cats and the people--readers, librarians, and cat lovers of all ages--who came together around them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
