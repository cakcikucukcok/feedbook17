  <title>A Good Man - Mark Shriver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this intimate portrait of an extraordinary father-son relationship, Mark K. Shriver discovers the moral principles that guided his legendary father and applies them to his own life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sargent &quot;Sarge&quot; Shriver--founder of the Peace Corps and architect of President Johnson&#39;s War on Poverty--died in 2011 after a valiant fight with Alzheimer&#39;s, thousands of tributes poured in from friends and strangers worldwide. These tributes, which extolled the daily kindness and humanity of &quot;a good man,&quot; moved his son Mark far more than those who lauded Sarge for his big-stage, headline-making accomplishments. After a lifetime searching for the path to his father&#39;s success in the public arena, Mark instead turns to a search for the secret of his father&#39;s joy, his devotion to others, and his sense of purpose. Mark discovers notes and letters from Sarge; hears personal stories from friends and family that zero in on the three guiding principles of Sarge&#39;s life--faith, hope, and love--and recounts moments with Sarge that now take on new value and poignancy. In the process, Mark discovers much about himself, as a father, as a husband, and as a social justice advocate. &lt;i&gt;A Good Man&lt;/i&gt; is an inspirational and deeply personal story about a son discovering the true meaning of his father&#39;s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
