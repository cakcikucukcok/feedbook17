  <title>It’S Part of Who I Am - Kay Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its Part of Who I Am: Searching for Spiritual Understanding&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; tells the story of one woman, Peace, who relentlessly seeks out spiritual understanding. Her daughter, Kay, explores the complexities involved in the life of her mother. She, in turn, finds that her exploration leads her to embark on her own spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kay Fraserwho holds a PhD in social historybrings her academic background to this intimate and personal account that follows Peace on a fifty-five year journey through many twists and turns. Peace begins with Christianity and then moves through a variety of teachingsGurdjieff, Krishnamurti, the Theosophical Society, Co-Freemasonry, and A Course in Miraclesbefore turning to Zen Buddhism for two decades. Finally she returns to the Christian Church. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her return to the church gave rise to many questions and answers between mother and daughter. Whenever Peace was asked why, after all her searching, she had returned to the church she would simply say Its part of who I am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are drawn to other peoples accounts of their spiritual journeys and wonder what insights they can provide for your own journey then &lt;i&gt;Its Part of Who I Am: Searching for Spiritual Understanding&lt;/i&gt; will give you some clues about how to find that deep spiritual core within. Yet, it also gives hints about how not to travel on your own journey. &lt;/p&gt;" />
