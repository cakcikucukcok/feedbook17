  <title>Grandfather&#39;s Search for Grandson - Jim Kuty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Robert Freels Jr., (Bob) along with his girlfriend, Maureen Wilkin, on June 21,1985 abducted my eight year old grandson, Jimmy. It wasnt until June 30, 1985 that the abduction was realized because Jimmy was supposedly on vacation with his father.  Deborah (Debbie) Freels, my daughter, and Bob had been separated for almost a year.  Debbie had custody of their two children, Jimmy, age eight and Dawn, age twelve. 
After eight months of searching, the trail led to Guatemala, Central America.
If it werent for strangers and incredible luck, the search would not have been successful.
The last month was spent by me in Guatemala, which I described in my notes as 30 Days of Hell.
This is a true story of my experiences." />
