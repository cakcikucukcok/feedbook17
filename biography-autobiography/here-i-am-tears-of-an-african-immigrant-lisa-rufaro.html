  <title>Here I Am: Tears of an African Immigrant - Lisa Rufaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lets be honest. We all have scars and dysfunctions and have been through something. You struggled through a life challenge. Your closest friend may not know it, but God does. What trials have happened or are still happening to you? Are you willing to show your scars? It takes faith to believe that the emotional and spiritual wounds of the trial are healed, even though there are still evident scars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God led my family and me through a testing trial to create high-level faith in our hearts. Sometimes God allows you to walk through your journey and lets you wander, question, and challenge your belief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an episodic memoir, this book depicts childhood experiences in Zimbabwe and an expedited family relocation to the United States. Although settling in America came with its natural challenges, nobody in my family anticipated my older brother facing a spiritual condition that would inhibit him from even attending school for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Family strife from my fathers side of the family has played a huge role for the woman I have become today. I am thankful for them. It would all make more sense later as an adult when I learned of the biblical story of Joseph. There are clear parallel experiences. After experiencing such betrayal by close relatives, what would all the midnight tears accumulate to? Today, I have learned to say, Here I am, Lord. Have your way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
