  <title>Boswell&#39;s Life of Johnson - James Boswell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791) is a biography of Dr. Samuel Johnson written by James Boswell. The work was a popular and critical success when first published. It is regarded as an important stage in the development of the modern genre of biography; many have claimed it as the greatest biography written in English, but some modern critics object that the work cannot be considered a proper biography. While Boswell&amp;#39;s personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson&amp;#39;s life by means of additional research. The biography takes many critical liberties with Johnson&amp;#39;s life, as Boswell makes various changes to Johnson&amp;#39;s quotations and even censors many comments. Nonetheless, modern biographers have found Boswell&amp;#39;s biography an important source of information on Johnson and his times." />
