  <title>An Immigrant’S Tale - Pradeep Kharé</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    An engaging and compelling story of immigration
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    In 1972, Pradeep Khar arrived in Canada from India to complete a masters degree in engineering. He had never flown before nor watched a television, yet
    he slowly made his way and decided to make Canada his home. Over the next several decades he carved out a successful career in the environmental field,
    eventually becoming an assistant deputy minister in British Columbia and then chief operating officer of the National Energy Board. Along the way he
    learned much about what it takes for an immigrant to adapt and flourish in Canada. This is his story.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Pradeep Khar tells a deeply personal story of how a committed and disciplined immigrant can achieve an extremely satisfying life in Canada by
    intermeshing the culture he was born into with the culture he came to. Whether you are a newcomer to Canada or someone trying to make a career in the civil
    service, you will find some wonderful advice and inspiration in this book.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Pradeep tells an engaging and compelling story of immigration success that highlights his generosity of spirit in acknowledging the support he received
    and understating the racism he encountered. His focus on succeeding for himself and his family in his new country is inspirational.
