  <title>The Underdogs - Melissa Fay Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From two-time National Book Award nominee Melissa Fay Greene comes a profound and surprising account of dogs on the front lines of rescuing both children and adults from the trenches of grief, emotional, physical, and cognitive disability, and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Underdogs&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Karen Shirk, felled at age twenty-four by a neuromuscular disease and facing life as a ventilator-dependent, immobile patient, who was turned down by every service dog agency in the country because she was &amp;#8220;too disabled.&amp;#8221; Her nurse encouraged her to tone down the suicidal thoughts, find a puppy, and raise her own service dog. Karen did this, and Ben, a German shepherd, dragged her back into life. &amp;#8220;How many people are stranded like I was,&amp;#8221; she wondered, &amp;#8220;who would lead productive lives if only they had a dog?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thousand state-of-the-art dogs later, Karen Shirk&amp;#8217;s service dog academy, 4 Paws for Ability, is restoring broken children and their families to life. Long shunned by scientists as a manmade, synthetic species, and oft- referred to as &amp;#8220;Man&amp;#8217;s Best Friend&amp;#8221; almost patronizingly, dogs are finally paid respectful attention by a new generation of neuroscientists and animal behaviorists. Melissa Fay Greene weaves the latest scientific discoveries about our co-evolution with dogs with Karen&amp;#8217;s story and a few exquisitely rendered stories of suffering children and their heartbroken families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written with characteristic insight, humanity, humor, and irrepressible joy, what could have been merely touching is a penetrating, compassionate exploration of larger questions: about our attachment to dogs, what constitutes a productive life, and what can be accomplished with unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
