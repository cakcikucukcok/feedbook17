  <title>It Was What It Was:  My Memoir - Diane Haley Toney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It Was What It Was is a charming and heartwarming autobiography of life growing up in the idyllic post-war era of the South during the 1950&#39;s.  Relating tales of family, love, self-sacrifice, faith, and community, the author recounts life in Lavonia, Georgia during an era of rapid social change.  From tales of wartime sacrifice, to the Mayberry-esque quality of small-town life, the booming economic growth in the post-war era, the heyday of the teenage social scene in the 1950s, and UFO encounters in the dark secluded countryside, this story has something for everyone.  In relating her childhood experiences and teenage years during and after the conclusion of World War II, and ending with her professional contributions in public education, Mrs. Toney&#39;s life story is overlaid and interwoven with the history of the small southern town of Lavonia. In doing so, her story is Lavonia&#39;s story.  Beautifully written and conveyed with warmth and much humor, this biography of times gone by is not to be missed!" />
