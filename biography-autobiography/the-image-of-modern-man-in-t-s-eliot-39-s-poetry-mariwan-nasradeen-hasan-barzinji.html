  <title>The Image of Modern Man in T. S. Eliot&#39;s Poetry - Mariwan Nasradeen Hasan Barzinji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Image of Modern Man in T. S. Eliot&#39;s Poetry
The book , presents an original understanding of The Image of Modern Man in T. S. Eliots complex and difficult poems in an easy and understandable  way.  Eliots vision of the Modern Man and the modern world is depicted throughout Eliots most well-known poems. Eliot was criticized by some critics for the quality of his work. The aim of this book is to show what an excellent and successful writer he is, to reveal the value and the contemporaneity of his work. His poetry is highly evaluated for its unique way of depicting the Modern humanity by realizing their problems  as well as finding solutions for them. 
The book is a great help not only for students, but also for researchers as the writer has spent much time in reading  Eliots Poems.  He has also written an ample introduction about modernism, modernity, modern literature and modern poetry, which might be enough to understand the rise of modern poetry.
... All of Eliots poems especially The Waste Land has presented readers with all the aspects of the modern life. Life is depicted as a mirror, broken and shattered into pieces as it is clear in the different parts of the poem. Eliot unlike many poets did not leave the modern man lost in despair but he finds them, their peace of mind by having a true and stable faith as well as their turning to God.
 The only solution for the entire problems of modern man is to turn to God and neglect the world that completely occupied them spiritually. 
...Modern man has lost his values especially women by only looking after children, many of them turned to prostitution because they did not have any source of income; therefore, they used that as a way to earn money to maintain life. These are the characteristics of the modern city, which are shared by all the countries, especially Europe. Eliot insists on the necessity of turning from world to God. He believed that God can solve their problems, because man or any other earthly power could not change that gloomy and aimless life, which modern man complained against." />
