  <title>And How Are You, Dr. Sacks? - Lawrence Weschler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The untold story of Dr. Oliver Sacks, his own most singular patient&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;[An] engrossing biographical memoir. This is Sacks at full blast: on endless ward rounds, observing his post-encephalitic patients . . . exulting over horseshoe crabs and chunks of Iceland spar.&quot; --Barbara Kiser, &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author Lawrence Weschler began spending time with Oliver Sacks in the early 1980s, when he set out to profile the neurologist for his own new employer, &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;. Almost a decade earlier, Dr. Sacks had published his masterpiece &lt;i&gt;Awakenings--&lt;/i&gt;the account of his long-dormant patients&#39; miraculous but troubling return to life in a Bronx hospital ward. But the book had hardly been an immediate success, and the rumpled clinician was still largely unknown. Over the ensuing four years, the two men worked closely together until, for wracking personal reasons, Sacks asked Weschler to abandon the profile, a request to which Weschler acceded. The two remained close friends, however, across the next thirty years and then, just as Sacks was dying, he urged Weschler to take up the project once again. This book is the result of that entreaty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weschler sets Sacks&#39;s brilliant table talk and extravagant personality in vivid relief, casting himself as a beanpole Sancho to Sacks&#39;s capacious Quixote. We see Sacks rowing and ranting and caring deeply; composing the essays that would form &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&lt;/i&gt;; recalling his turbulent drug-fueled younger days; helping his patients and exhausting his friends; and waging intellectual war against a medical and scientific establishment that failed to address his greatest concern: the spontaneous specificity of the individual human soul. And all the while he is pouring out a stream of glorious, ribald, hilarious, and often profound conversation that establishes him as one of the great talkers of the age. Here is the definitive portrait of Sacks as our preeminent romantic scientist, a self-described &quot;clinical ontologist&quot; whose entire practice revolved around the single fundamental question he effectively asked each of his patients: How &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; you? Which is to say, How &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; you &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A question which Weschler, with this book, turns back on the good doctor himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
