  <title>Box of Mustaches - Stan A. Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Box of Mustaches&lt;/i&gt; is the powerful, true story of identical twin brothers and how they coped with their mother&#39;s descent into madness.&lt;p&gt;
At first, Stanley and Jimmy Evans thought their mother was normal, but they soon discovered that her twisted views and mood swings were a result of her schizophrenia.  And the mental illness was making her more dangerous by the moment.  Their journey took them from orphanages to the television studio of a televangelist to a front-yard shooting that would liberate them from their nightmare.  The fabled &lt;i&gt;Box of Mustaches&lt;/i&gt; they pined for was really a fake facial hair kit advertised in comic books, but also their metaphor for the absurdity of adult life thrust upon them at a young age.  Interlaced with shocking drama and dark humor, &lt;i&gt;Box of Mustaches&lt;/i&gt; is an absorbing tale of survival.  It is also a satirical look at the cynical, sex-charged, American culture of the &#39;70s.&lt;/p&gt;" />
