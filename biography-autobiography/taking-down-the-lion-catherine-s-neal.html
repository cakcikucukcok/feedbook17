  <title>Taking Down the Lion - Catherine S. Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the widely-admired CEO of Tyco International, Dennis Kozlowski grew a little-known New Hampshire conglomerate into a global giant. In a stunning series of events, Kozlowski suddenly lost his job along with his favored public status when he was indicted by legendary Manhattan DA Robert Morgenthau--it was an inglorious end to an otherwise brilliant career. Kozlowski was the face of corporate excess in the turbulent post-Enron environment; he was pictured under headlines that read &quot;Oink Oink,&quot; and publicly castigated for his extravagant lifestyle. &quot;Deal-a-Day Dennis&quot; was transformed into the &quot;poster child for corporate greed.&quot; Kozlowski was ultimately convicted of grand larceny and other crimes that, in sum, found the former CEO guilty of wrongfully taking $100 million from Tyco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taking Down the Lion&lt;/i&gt; shines a bright light on former CEO Dennis Kozlowski and the Tyco corporate scandal--it is the definitive telling of a largely misunderstood episode in U.S. business history. In an unfiltered view of corporate America, Catherine Neal pulls back the curtain to reveal a world of big business, ambition, money, and an epidemic of questionable ethics that infected not only business dealings but extended to attorneys, journalists, politicians, and the criminal justice system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the ugly truth is told, it&#39;s clear the &quot;good guys&quot; were not all good and the &quot;bad guys&quot; not all bad. And there were absolutely no heroes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
