  <title>Goodbye Palestine - Eric Vedsegaard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eric Vedsegaard could not serve his compulsory military duty in his home country of Denmark until there arose an opportunity for him to serve it in England. Much against his wishes, he ended up in an elite paratroop regiment, which brought him to hot spots in both the Far East and the Middle East and it was during these very sensitive post-war years that he experienced great historic upheavals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote in this book his personal account while he was with the British army. These writings were later characterized by the Head of Accessions of the Danish Library Center as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This book is a fantastic and exciting account. Vedsegaard is excellent at unfolding his personal experiences in the right historical perspective, so that after reading it, one has become much wiser.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it was also further described by Bob Cobley, a Senior Adviser of the British Embassy in Denmark as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A moving memoir of a soldier who lost friends during his service but still lays, on his 90th year, a poppy wreath to their memory. I unashamedly and proudly recommend this book.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
