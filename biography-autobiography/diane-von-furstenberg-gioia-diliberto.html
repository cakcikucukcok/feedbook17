  <title>Diane von Furstenberg - Gioia Diliberto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A sweeping biography of one of the most influential and controversial legends of late twentieth-century fashion, an iconic designer whose colorful creations, including the &amp;#8220;wrap dress,&amp;#8221; captured the modern feminist spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a Holocaust survivor and wife of an Austrian nobleman, Diane von Furstenberg burst onto New York&amp;#8217;s fashion scene in 1969, and within a few years became an international sensation with her colorful wrap dress in printed jersey. Embraced by millions of American women of all ages, sizes, and shapes, the dress became a cult object and symbol of women&amp;#8217;s liberation, tied inexorably to the image of youth, independence, and sex Diane herself projected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this masterful biography, Gioia Diliberto brings Diane&amp;#8217;s extraordinary life into focus, from her post-World-War-II childhood in Belgium, through her rise to the top of the fashion world during the decadent seventies and glamorous go-go eighties, to her humiliating failures both professional and personal, and her remarkable comeback in the nineties. Like Coco Chanel, Diane has always been her own best advertisement. Morphing from a frizzy brunette outsider in a sea of sleek blondes to a stunning pop cultural icon, she embodied the brand she created&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;the DVF woman,&amp;#8221; a model of self-sufficiency, sensuality, and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diliberto&amp;#8217;s captivating, balanced portrait, based on scores of interviews with Diane&amp;#8217;s family, friends, lovers, employees, and the designer herself, explores von Furstenberg&amp;#8217;s relationships with her husbands and lovers, and illuminates fashion&amp;#8217;s evolution from rare luxury to marketing monster and the development of a uniquely American style. Lively and insightful, the book also explores the larger world of the nation&amp;#8217;s elite, where fashion, culture, society, politics, and Hollywood collide. &lt;em&gt;Diane von Furstenberg&lt;/em&gt; is a modern fable of self-invention, fame, wealth, failure, and success that mirrors late-twentieth century America itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
