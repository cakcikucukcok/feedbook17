  <title>How to Win Friends, Kick Ass and Influence People - Lynne Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After fifteen years of international exposure as an anchor for CNN&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Headline News&lt;/i&gt;, Lynne Russell has become one of the most recognized and beloved women working in broadcast journalism. Renowned for her on-air combination of professionalism and irrepressible energy, Russell is every bit as remarkable off camera as she is on. Not only does she know her way around a newsroom, but as a private investigator, bodyguard, and black belt, she is a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell writes, for the first time, about her amazing life, from her memories of childhood as a self-described nomad following her army father around the globe, to a frank look at her ill-advised early marriage, to her steady rise through the ranks of radio and television. Then she turns her attention to what her remarkable achievements have taught her about work, love, body language, and the best little shoe store on the Champs Elysée, and gives us her gutsy advice for life today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
