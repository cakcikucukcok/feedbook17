  <title>Can I Say - Travis Barker, Gavin Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Travis Barker&amp;#8217;s soul-baring memoir chronicles the highlights and lowlights of the renowned drummer&amp;#8217;s art and his life, including the harrowing plane crash that nearly killed him and his traumatic road to recovery&amp;#8212;a fascinating never-before-told-in-full story of personal reinvention grounded in musical salvation and fatherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After breaking out as the acclaimed drummer of the multiplatinum punk band Blink-182, everything changed for Travis Barker. But the dark side of rock stardom took its toll: his marriage, chronicled for an MTV reality show, fell apart. Constant touring concealed a serious drug addiction. A reckoning did not truly come until he was forced to face mortality: His life nearly ended in a horrifying plane crash, and then his close friend, collaborator, and fellow crash survivor DJ AM died of an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blunt, driving memoir, Barker ruminates on rock stardom, fatherhood, death, loss, and redemption, sharing stories shaped by decades&amp;#8217; worth of hard-earned insights. His pulsating memoir is as energetic as his acclaimed beats. It brings to a close the first chapters of a well-lived life, inspiring readers to follow the rhythms of their own hearts and find meaning in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
