  <title>Sticks, Stones &amp; Songs - Eleanor Corey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1937, with the cash in his pocket, Arthur Corey purchases a grange hall, a derelict, drafty, long-deserted building destined to become the family residence into which babies, including the author, are born, one after another, after another. These children learn lessons via the school of hard knocks, transform throw-aways into tools, and become all too familiar with an outhouse where catalogs are used instead of toilet paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Arthur paid the auctioneer, buttoned his threadbare tweed overcoat, pinched the front creases of his brown fedora, and settled it on his head. He bounded down the courthouse steps and scurried up the sidewalk, document in handit was a done deal! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt from Sticks, Stones &amp; Songs Chronicle One&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticks, Stones &amp; Songs is a powerful recounting of faith in real life that crescendos through the years. I loved getting to know the Corey family through this story and was encouraged in my walk with God!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Phillips, MLP Reporting, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleanor Corey drew me into a multi-generational memoir of her rural American family. She has embraced candor in telling the story of her clan within the context of community and history in a way that is vulnerable and transparent. Sticks, Stones &amp; Songs will inspire you to recover your own ancestral secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidi Mitchell, Literary Agent, D. C. Jacobson &amp; Associates, LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticks, Stones &amp; Songs offers a rare glimpse of a bygone era and the people who made the woods of the wild Pacific Northwest their home. This is no sugar-coated account but life as it was with all its raw edges and loose ends.&lt;/p&gt;
