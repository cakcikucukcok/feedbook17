  <title>Network Africa-A Complex System - John David Cluett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Royalties of the sale of this book go towards supporting children in South Africa&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This book is organised into four parts that are interrelated as a thread that runs through my 70 year life as a person, and as a researcher on topics that are dealt with in the corresponding parts in the body of this book. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do not claim any exclusivity to any of these learnings that have been researched and published by me, as can be seen at the end of the book under Bibliography, but put them at the service of the readers that they may apply them and add value to their own lives and business scenarios. I also stress the importance of cultural beliefs and gender issues, as they are key to effective communication and peace. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 1 traces my life in Spain during the Civil War and World War 2 at Rio Tinto and my schooling at Stonyhurst College a traditional Catholic school. I married in Malta and had two children. This ended in separation and divorce leading to my living apart from my children for 20 years. The scenario of my family in South Africa outlines the marriage and establishment of a peaceful and secure home environment and eventually being reunited with the family in Malta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 2 describes my 50 year career in brewing industry with experiences in Malta, Denmark, India, USA, Canada, Spain, China  Hong Kong, Mozambique and South Africa. The political changes in South Africa in 1994 brought with it many challenges to integrate the previously disadvantaged majority of people into equal living, working and educational standards and conditions. Business travel to various parts of the world required ongoing communication with local and business people to forge relationships that have lasted over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 3 deals with the social, religious and political scenarios in Spain, during the Civil War and World War 2, in India and in South Africa, and how these effected the working environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part 4. Network Africa  A Complex System, originally conceived by me in 1998, describes a process of change that can be applied in many Complex Systems. .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It explains the elements required to achieve change in a peaceful and sustainable manner within different world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
