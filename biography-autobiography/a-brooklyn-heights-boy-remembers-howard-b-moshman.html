  <title>A Brooklyn Heights Boy Remembers - Howard B. Moshman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Howard Moshmans memoirs are collected in an eminently readable book combining high humor and mature comments. In the shadow of the Great Depression he recalls cold winters and hot summers, classrooms crowded with children of immigrants, ancient libraries and 15-cent movies, teachers good and bad. During high school he worked as a soda jerk and handyman in his brother-in-laws pharmacy. Between college and dental school he helped a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History, then performed Wasserman tests at the New York State Serological Laboratory. He recounts his service as a Navy dentist at stateside training centers, Pacific sea duty on a troop transport, ten cushy months on Oahu with collateral duty as a recorder (district attorney) of the summary court. Meet a cast of unusual characters including two over-the-hill automobiles, a martinet captain, an incident-prone pilot and a long-lost Chinese colleague. The GI bill helped in the transition back to civilian life. A blind date led to a marriage that has lasted 63 years and is still going strong. The last three chapters are reflections on dentistry after 60 years of practice.&lt;/P&gt;" />
