  <title>Lubek&#39;s Threelogy, the Sweet Science 2: - Jan Lubek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In my first book, my hero Rocky Marciano &amp; classic boxing are discussed. Me &amp; my grandma Ms. Wanda Nida gave the original idea to create Rocky statue in Brockton. IT WAS NOT WBC/ NO GOOD SULAIMAN FAMILY&#39;S IDEA! In this book you will find out lots of information on Rocky you never knew nor heard before. Special attention is given to Rocky&#39;s exhibitions in Asia (especially Japan to entertain the troops) &amp; Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. Archie Moore was not the last fighter Rocky faced in the ring in front of the audience because it happened in Rio. Also lots of information on Superfight Rocky had with Ali. Discover Rocky&#39;s business ventures, his life during &amp; after boxing. Find out why Bob Baker was supposed to be Rocky&#39;s final opponent &amp; so much, much, much more.

Find out who might have killed him. Were Toni &amp; Eddie Mannix behind that? If not, they certainly played a role in his death. Find out who stole George&#39;s pet dog. Find out about George&#39;s wish to be a pro boxer &amp; wrestler. Find out more about Luger gun that killed George, find out about 26 new Superman episodes George agreed to star in them &amp; direct them, etc . . .

I cover companies such as Duo-Art, Welte-Mignon, Ampico A &amp; B and many others. I cover story of Vorsetzer, a machine with wooden fingers that played the piano, reproducing the sounds of great masters like Paderewski, Saint-Saens, Hofmann &amp; many, many others. Even if they are no longer with us their spirit lives on in these reproducing piano rolls played by their ghosts. Genius never dies my grandma said in Latin: &quot;Dignum laude virum, Musa vetat mori&quot; Goddess Musa does not allow noble &amp; what&#39;s or who is immortal to die. Find out about technical aspects of Vorsetzers, Piano-Players, Player-Pianos. It&#39;s not the same. Music is art, research this kind of music more in depth.
