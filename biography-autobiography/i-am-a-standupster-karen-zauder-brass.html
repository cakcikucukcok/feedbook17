  <title>I Am a Standupster - Karen Zauder Brass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am a Standupster, A Second Generation Survivors Account, by the Daughter of David Zauder, is the first-ever biography of Internationally Acclaimed Holocaust and Anti-bullying Educator and Speaker, Karen Zauder Brass. Her book is a very rare exploration into the effects of being raised by a parent who suffered the inhumanity of genocide and its unimaginable costs.
Brass comes out of the shadows and openly expresses what so few Second Generation Survivors are willing to discuss. The deep injury to their survivor parents psyches cannot simply be put aside and has deep and lasting effects on their children. From her earliest years, Brass was fully aware of who her surviving parent needed her to be. This is a book of deep introspection that also shares the Authors path to self-acceptance, happiness, and her powerful desire to make changes in our world by educating audiences, one human being at a time, to not stand by and allow for the suffering of others; To be a Standupster.
Brass provides the descriptive background of her Father, David Zauders survival of the Krakow Ghetto and four concentration camps including Auschwitz. His survival of a true hell on Earth, and his success in emigrating from Poland, after his liberation by General Pattons 3rd Army Tank Division, then travel from Germany to America and becoming one of this countrys leading cornet and trumpet players will inspire you and touch your heart.
For educators, Brass weaves her Fathers story into a groundbreaking international anti-bullying campaign which has been experienced by thousands of Middle and High School aged students, adults, and hundreds of high-ranking military officials. Acclaimed by educators, principals and parents alike, Brass Standupster presentations and campaign has been effective in reducing bullying in schools because it provides a rallying cry for everyone to never stand by in the face of hatred, bigotry, and injustice;  the program calls on the audience to use personal responsibility and moral leadership to rise together as being a Standupster to stop the bullying." />
