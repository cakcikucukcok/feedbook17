  <title>Crossing Rivers, Climbing Mountains, Building Bridges - Jacqueline La-Touche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charged Convicted and Condemned, thrown into life as a young mother at the age of just 15 years old.  Jacqueline La-Touch was faced with the prejudice of being a teenage mother, feeling that she had to prove to her parents, and others, most of all herself that she could be the best mother that she could for her child. While she was still proving her worth, her life was rocked by yet another big decision that any girl, or woman could make in their life.
In 1982 her parents immigrated to Jamaica, to fulfill their dreams, leaving her behind, and not knowing that their daughter would experience the unexpected and unknown, Life became a day to day battle, and one long nightmare, for this young mother. 
Destined for a life of hardship and heartache. Depravation haunted her life each day, a reminder of where she was, Nowhere.
Loveless  and abusive relationships, played their part in her life, she felt trapped by her situation, as she remembered sayings of you made your bed, so you lay in it,  With no mother to turn to for guidance and strength, she raised her children, alone.  Loss of control over her life, and ashamed to let anyone know, what her life represented at that time, heartache, a secret which she was ashamed of but was the only control that she had over her life could have ended it, She fought a daily battle, with herself, a love hate relationship, but then her life changed in a way that she never would have imagined, a way she had never known.
Love and Happiness, comes into her life, and she is happy again, but for how long. Just as she thinks that all her troubles are over, they had only just begun.
Faith dealt some cruel hands in this mothers life, her faith had been tested so many times, with family, friends, and all the people that were dear to her, the people that she had trusted and loved. 
Her life changes for the better, when she decides to make a positive change in her life, Jacqueline had become so engrossed in her problems, that she could not see the forest from the trees.
A new life, discovering new things, places, relationships, happiness, and the three Gs, God Given Gifts, which she would  learn to take control of, and embrace the good in herself, using it in a positive way. Lifes ups and downs and big changes were still waiting to happen.  
Crossing rivers climbing mountains, how would she conquer them all, would she be able to find some sort of peace, and be able to build bridges, This is an inspiring account of Jacqueline La-Touches    life, and how she managed to endure, but not losing sight of her faith and hope, having the determination and courage to fight her way through life, and still believe in her dreams." />
