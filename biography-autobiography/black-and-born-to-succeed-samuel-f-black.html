  <title>Black and Born to Succeed - Samuel F. Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have blood relative spanning one hundred years and in their best interest I believe my life experiences should be shared with the world. It is my belief that GOD does not wish the following issues to fade quietly into the night but to be brought brightly into the light.
What concerns me is not the way things are, but the way people think things are. I filed discrimination claims with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against the military defense contractor and EEOC as well as the Office of Federal Contracts Compliance (OFCC) claims against one of this nations leading higher education catholic universities and received (not unexpected) unfavorable federal court proceeding results from both agencies.
My concerns are in the area of fair and equal (or the lack thereof) practice in employment opportunities for male Americans of African descent. I worked for two of the largest employers in area one a military defense contractor and the other higher education catholic university.
Both employers release me during economical hard times (as lifes history has it Blacks were the last hired and the first fired) the first after (16) years of excellent services in 1993 for alleged reduction in workforce and the other after (10) years of excellent services for alleged performance issues in 2005.
Where as in the case of EEOC the director and its leading attorney were both American of African decent, however in general the perceived notion is that both individuals would view this from an objective view point as an opportunity to potentially help correct past employment practices by employers that utilize government funds and discretely discriminate against various protected class minority employees.
This activity continually go untested and while the disservices I experienced only perpetuate status quo practices of the past, by both EEOC and the Employers. 
EEOC performed as I had anticipated (with defense contractor) the findings resulted in there was reasonable cause to believe I had been discriminated against, however the agencies leading attorney when it came to negotiating a fair and reasonable settlement amount favored with the employer and refuse to negotiate. He recommended I pursue outside legal counsel I was provided a letter of the right to sue the employer. I didnt have a chance in hell of over coming big business and the relationship private attorneys have with big business. A couple private attorney firms only conceded to the same standards as EEOC and lacked the will to negotiate.
Where are the adjudicators for the people that will judge rightly in every matter brought before them? Due to a lack of financial resources and the ability to appeal the summary judgment after five years of legal proceedings the case was ultimately dismissed.
Employers continually go untested and the disservices to protected class employees serves notice that nothing will become of filing a complaint against your employer.
Little did I know the learning experiences throughout this process would come in handy some ten years later.
The case of OFCC the director and its leading investigator were both white women minorities, the perceived notion is that both individuals would view this from an objective view point as an opportunity to potentially help correct discriminating employment practices by employers that discretely discriminate against the various protected class minority employees. 
I repeat again where are the adjudicators for the people that will judge rightly in every matter brought before them? 
OFCC leading investigator did exceptionally well, however due to circumstance beyond the investigators control the ultimate finding were politically manipulated in favor of the university. 
The action by the director allows the employers continually go untested and was a disservice to protected class employees.
The University was granted a summary judgment finding by the legal justice system, h" />
