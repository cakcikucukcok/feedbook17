  <title>Aaron Copland - Howard Pollack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A candid and fascinating portrait of the American composer. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Aaron Copland (1900-1990) became one of America&#39;s most beloved and esteemed composers. His work, which includes Fanfare for the Common Man, A Lincoln Portrait, and Appalachian Spring, has been honored by a huge following of devoted listeners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the full richness of Copland&#39;s life and accomplishments has never, until now, been documented or understood. Howard Pollack&#39;s meticulously researched and engrossing biography explores the symphony of Copland&#39;s life: his childhood in Brooklyn; his homosexuality; Paris in the early 1920s; the Alfred Stieglitz circle; his experimentation with jazz; the communist witch trials; Hollywood in the forties; public disappointment with his later, intellectual work; and his struggle with Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Furthermore, Pollack  presents informed discussions of Copland&#39;s music, explaining and clarifying its newness and originality, its aesthetic and social aspects, its distinctive and enduring personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only a success in its own right, but a valuable model of what biography can and probably should be. &quot; - &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
