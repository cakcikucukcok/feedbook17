  <title>Candlelight in a Storm - Naveen Sridhar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Candlelight in a Storm by Naveen Sridhar is the historical biography of his wife. Born during World War II and fleeing the violence there, later fleeing communist regimes as a teenager, and traveling the world, her story is at once colorful and harrowing. John F. Kennedy came to Germany and said Ich bin ein Berliner, signifying that Germany did not need to be forever tarnished with the legacy of the Nazi party, and there was a generation of Germans looking to establish peace and freedom in the country. Candlelight in a Storm is the ode to this generation. 
Self-published historical memoirs can, at times, seem like a vanity project, i.e. something for the family to read, but less interesting for the casual, unaffiliated reader. Sridhar doesnt fall into this trap due to the strength of his writing and the thoroughness of his research. As he makes clear in his introduction, he interviewed many people to prepare this book, so this is far more than a family history, its a history of an entire generation. 
For anyone thinking of writing this sort of family biography, this is a textbook in how to do it: combine objective overview with subjective experience. It helps that Sridhars writing is so stylistically rich. The narrative manages to be both detailed and breezy, with enough dialogue to make it really come to life, rather than being a turgid, fact-driven history. 
If you are interested in World War II and havent gotten the other side of the story, Candlelight in a Storm is a good place to begin, and succeeds in telling an oft-neglected side of the history of these events.4.5 stars SPR Book Review. www.selfpublishingreview.com 
A must-read for those interested in Germany, the UK, and India post-World War Two. A fascinating, well-written book by an author who was there.Dan Poynter, author of The Self-Publishing Manual" />
