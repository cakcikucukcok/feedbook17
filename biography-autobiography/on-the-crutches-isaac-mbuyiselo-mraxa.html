  <title>On the Crutches - Isaac Mbuyiselo Mraxa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am the witness of my disability and  
I know how to be disabled. I know 
how to be stigmatized by the people
whom you never did something wrong
to them. I know how to live in
discrimination because of the
disability I never intended to have, 
but all those things are nothing because the only dangerous
weapon that kills the expectations of any disabled person is the
WORD that many people use; thinking that they are showing
their kindness.  Yet they do not know that they are killing the
strength of mind of the disabled, they keep on using the word
SHAME as if all is well to the disabled person.  In actuality it is
not good to be disabled.  It is not magnificent to depend on
somebodys kindness and willingness to quench your desire." />
