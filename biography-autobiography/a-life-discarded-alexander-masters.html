  <title>A Life Discarded - Alexander Masters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alexander Masters, the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Stuart: A Life Backwards&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;asks you to join him in celebrating an unknown and important life left on the scrap heap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, 148 tattered and mold-covered notebooks were discovered lying among broken bricks in a skip on a building site in Cambridge. Tens of thousands of pages were filled to the edges with urgent handwriting. They were a small part of an intimate, anonymous diary, starting in 1952 and ending half a century later, a few weeks before the books were thrown out. Over five years, the award-winning biographer Alexander Masters uncovers the identity and real history of their author, with an astounding final revelation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Life Discarded &lt;/i&gt;is a true, shocking, poignant, often hilarious story of an ordinary life. The author of the diaries, known only as &#39;I,&#39; is the tragicomic patron saint of everyone who feels their life should have been more successful. Part thriller, part love story, part social history, &lt;i&gt;A Life Discarded&lt;/i&gt; is a biographical detective story that unfolds with the suspense of a mystery but has all the warmth, respect, humor, and dazzling originality that made Masters&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Stuart: A Life Backwards &lt;/i&gt;such a beloved book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
