  <title>Cardboard Gods: An All-American Tale Told Through Baseball Cards - Josh Wilker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Cardboard Gods&lt;/I&gt; is the memoir of Josh Wilker, a brilliant writer who has marked the stages of his life through the baseball cards he collected as a child. It also captures the experience of growing up obsessed with baseball cards and explores what it means to be a fan of the game. Along the way, as we get to know Josh, his family, and his friends, we also get Josh&amp;#8217;s classic observations about the central artifacts from his life: the baseball cards themselves. Josh writes about an imagined correspondence with his favorite player, Carl Yastrzemski; he uses the magical bubble-blowing powers of journeyman Kurt Bevacqua to shed light on the weakening of the powerful childhood bond with his older brother; he considers the doomed utopian back-to-the-land dreams of his hippie parents against the backdrop of inimitable 1970s baseball figures such as &amp;#147;Designated Pinch Runner&amp;#8221; Herb Washington and Mark &amp;#147;The Bird&amp;#8221; Fidrych. &lt;I&gt;Cardboard Gods&lt;/I&gt; is more than just the story of a man who can&amp;#8217;t let go of his past, it&amp;#8217;s proof that &amp;#151; to paraphrase Jim Bouton &amp;#151; as children we grow up holding baseball cards but in the end we realize that it&amp;#8217;s really the other way around.&lt;/div&gt;" />
