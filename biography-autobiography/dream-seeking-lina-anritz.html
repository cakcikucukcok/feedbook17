  <title>Dream Seeking - Lina Anritz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lin and Richard, like so many people, dreamed of a life in the sun, away from the pace and problems of their stressed lives as teachers.
&lt;p&gt;
Summer holidays in Europe were always over too quickly, and they began to feel the attraction of life in Greece.
&lt;p&gt;
After an &#39;accidental&#39; holiday on the small Greek island of Nisyros, albeit having been badly organised by a tour company which promptly went out of business, the spell was well and truly cast.
&lt;p&gt;
After several more visits to the island during the holidays, ill-health caused a change in their circumstances in England.  Whilst enjoying the freedom to walk, read and generally slowdown, they felt that now was the opportunity to seek their dream.
&lt;p&gt;
Packing an elderly Landrover, Richard and Garry, the son of a friend, drove to Nisyros, whilst Lin and their daughter Sue, took the more obvious route and flew.
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking only limited Greek on an island where so few of the inhabitants spoke little or no English, created both frustration and hilarity!
&lt;p&gt;
Sue and her friend Amy stayed for a part of the summer, their presence causing a significant stir amongst the people of the small mountain village of Nikia where Lin, Richard and Garry had made their home.
&lt;p&gt;
From killing the pig to burying the donkey; from cleaning rooms to repairing doors; from washing in well-water inhabited by several species of aquatic life, to dancing at the festivals, their life was filled with a variety and richness of experiences which have to be read to be believed.
&lt;p&gt;
This year was the beginning of the realisation of their dream.
