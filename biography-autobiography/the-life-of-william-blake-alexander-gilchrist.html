  <title>The Life of William Blake - Alexander Gilchrist</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;One of the greatest Victorian-era biographies, Alexander Gilchrist&#39;s &lt;I&gt;The Life of William Blake&lt;/I&gt; plays a key role in the history of Blake&#39;s work and its influence on other writers and artists. The first standard text on Blake and a cornerstone of the extensive scholarship on his life and work, it not only delivered its subject from unjust obscurity but also dispelled the notion of Blake&#39;s insanity and established his genius as a visionary artist and poet.&lt;BR&gt;Sensitive, highly readable accounts trace Blake&#39;s childhood and years as an engraver&#39;s apprentice, his relations with patrons and employers, his trial for treason, and his declining health and untimely death. The author&#39;s wide-ranging research includes interviews with many of Blake&#39;s surviving friends, whose personal recollections add warmth and immediacy to this portrait. Extensive quotes from the subject&#39;s poetry and prose &amp;#8212; practically unknown at the time of the original 1863 publication &amp;#8212; further enliven the text. In addition to a critical commentary on Blake&#39;s boyhood poems, this transformative biography features more than 40 of his illustrations.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
