  <title>The Book of Asher - Sonia Usatch-Kuhn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Asher Leon Edelstein has been described as a spirited, learned, force of naturea complex, focused man on-the-go. He lived his life guided by seven principles: gratitude, friendship, smiles, connectedness, honor, reverence and acceptance. Become acquainted with this Raleigh, North Carolina dynamo, who, consistently remained true to his love of Torah, family and every stranger who crossed his path under all manner of circumstance. Feel the energy of the first Jewish basketball player for Georgia Tech, his escapades on the golf course (including Augusta), his sweetly-filled teaching method that endeared him to his coming-of-age bar and bat mitzvah students. Ashers cantorial voice enthralled the congregants of Beth Meyer Synagogue. Story-teller, food lover and mover and shaker, Asher was inspirational." />
