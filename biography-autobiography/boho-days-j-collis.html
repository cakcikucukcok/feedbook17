  <title>Boho Days - J. Collis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m writing one great song before I&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Jonathan Larson died, he left behind a musical poised to become a world-spanning phenomenon. When RENT struck, Larson became a legend - and his work legendary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But legends and overnight successes are never spawned from nothing, and the story of how Jonathan Larson became a Tony Award winning composer and Pulitzer Prize winning dramatist has never been covered in depth - until now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By looking at Larson&amp;rsquo;s entire 16-year output, Boho Days looks at not just how RENT and tick, tick&amp;hellip; BOOM! came to life but where they came from - and how they really fit into Larson&amp;rsquo;s work as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Featuring new interviews with Larson&amp;rsquo;s creative and personal associates and extensive archival research, Boho Days demystifies the composer&amp;rsquo;s vision and advancement, offering fans new and old the full story of the man behind the musical which changed the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think Jonathan Larson would have really enjoyed reading this book. I wish he could have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
