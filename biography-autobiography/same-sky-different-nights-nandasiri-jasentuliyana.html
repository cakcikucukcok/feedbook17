  <title>Same Sky, Different Nights - Nandasiri Jasentuliyana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This autobiography, set in the social, economic and educational history of Sri Lanka (Ceylon), is an exceptionally informative and entertaining work. Nandasiri Jasentuliyana describes his humble beginnings, his sports oriented youth, and the successes and stresses of his carefully directed education. He recounts the triumphs and tragedies of his adult life with a humor, perceptiveness and profundity rarely consolidated in any single work. Every page rewards the reader with exploding colors in this kaleidoscope of the authors journey through life. Stephen E. Doyle, Honorary Director, International Institute of Space Law ; formerly, White House Counsel on Space and Telecommunications Policy, and NASA Adviser on International Affairs. The authors route from an obscure Sinhala-Buddhist village school in Sri Lanka to the summit of the United Nations was inevitably long, winding and arduous. He left in its wake an outstanding academic and professional track record. The story of the boy from the South, who climbed the dizzy heights of international mountains, overcoming obstacles on the way to the top of the United Nations, is an untold saga, which is revealed in these pages." />
