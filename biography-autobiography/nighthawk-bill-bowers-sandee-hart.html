  <title>Nighthawk - Bill Bowers, Sandee Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During his senior year in high school, author Bill Bowers needed to make some tough decisions about his life path. At seventeen, he made a commitment to join the Air Force. On October 5, 1984, he began his military career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nighthawk A Young Airmans Tour at Clark Air Base, he recounts his coming of age in the 1980s while stationed at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Through a series of vignettes centered on the antics and comedic misadventures of a young airmans first tour of duty, this memoir offers a mirror of who we are as individuals. It shares real-life stories that explore the ups and downs of service in the military, the culture and economy of the Philippines, and the actions of a bunch of kids tossed onto an island paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nighthawk A Young Airmans Tour at Clark Air Base focuses on a self-proclaimed screw-up with a moral compass that often causes conflict. It tells how an eighteen-year-old kid fresh out of high school became a man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
