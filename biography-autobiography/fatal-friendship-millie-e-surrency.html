  <title>Fatal Friendship - Millie E. Surrency</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of a Military family retiring and choosing to live in a Middle class suburb located in Southern Florida.
The family thinks they have finally found the perfect place to call home until they meet Thelma a devious, conniving and ruthless woman.
Murder, mystery, happiness, racism and mayhem all the ingredients a woman needed to satisfy her  greed and determination to have her way no matter the cost including embezzlement and possible murder.
Such a small close knit community terrorized so horribly by one woman the Peoples court singled them out to tell their story on national television.
The 2000 Presidential election controversy in Florida has nothing on this Story.  It reveals a behind the scenes look at politics at its worse. The best and the worse of our judicial system.
Could the contents of this story if told sooner have decided the 2000 presidential election?" />
