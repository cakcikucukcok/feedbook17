  <title>Space and My Life (A Layman’S Choice of Understanding) - Samir Kanti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author Samir is a Geologist. The basic job of a geologist is Search  search for the history of evolution of Earth with its rocks and minerals, oceans and climate, for the history of life on Earth and so on. The word Search got embossed in the mind of the author. While continuing search for minerals in the mainland India, in the Andaman and Nicobar group of islands, in the then USSR, in the African countries during the last 50 years (his present age being 73), he did not know when his mind got inclined to those eminent persons who started searching for the Creator of the Universe through deep meditations and to those scientists who were/are involved in searching for the different episodes of the Universe through their scientific abilities. God, Space and Universe are very tempting words where you can keep your mind for hours, either in meditation, or, on cups of teas, while fighting and debating with your friends. 
The sailing of the author for 73 years, like a leaf floating on the river, has gathered many memories and experiences, as teaching from the life. There were many critical situations, when he has felt that there is someone to extend His helping hands to protect him. 
The book narrates the impact of the changing Time-Space scenario in his life and the touch of Helping Hands in the journey of his life along with his ideas and some logical feelings regarding God, Space, Time, Universe and Life. There must be some logical conclusion honoring the observations of the enlightened saints and of the scientists. 
Read and give your thoughts and feelings. Place Love on God, love on Space and love on His creation, the Universe  love in totality for the totality." />
