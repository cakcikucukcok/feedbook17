  <title>My Burning Story - Minister Sarudzai Dorcas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The deep moving burning story by Dorcas Shekina Sarudzai Mudzi waKujinga is a profound testimony of her life and her breath taking road to Christ. Her experiences as a freedom fighter and a disciple of Christ show that it only takes faith to keep going despite facing extraordinary obstacles. She viewed these obstacles as ladders to blessings and found reason for all those escapes from untold suffering from a tender age to date. 
In this book we learn extracts from Dorcas diary over the course of several years; the everyday challenges and note a few life-changing. Combined with these  episodes are bible based reflections, each one highlighting a particular insight that can help the reader to face difficult situations with hope. The book encourages the reader to seeking to grow his/her faith in the God who can transform us into extraordinary disciples.  Dorcas then known as Sarudzai Churucheminzwa also wrote a book in 1976 entitled WHY I JOINED THE ARMED STRUGGLE BY SARUDZAI CHURUCHEMINZWA. This she used in sourcing morale and material support during the armed struggle of her native country Zimbabwe.  
She is a single mother with four biological children, two adopted and four spiritual daughters.  They are all grown up with their own families now. We all need encouragement, but we also need challenges  and sometimes we are not so willing to be changed out of our daily routine and our comfort zones.  This book gives insight to how Dorcas faced these challenges. She also shows relevancy of reading the Bible, and how important it is to apply biblical principals to real life situations in order to succeed, and manage our sorrows as well as our joys.  Dorcas from a worldly soldier to a Christ like soldier, I Salute! You! 21 Gun salute." />
