  <title>Down and out in Paris and London - George Orwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To be poor and destitute in 1920s Paris and London was to experience life at its lowest ebb. George Orwell, penniless and with nowhere to go, found himself experiencing just this as he wandered the streets of both capitals in search of a job. By day, he tramped the streets, often passing time with &amp;#39;screevers&amp;#39; or street artists, drunks and other hobos. At night, he stood in line for a bed in a &amp;#39;spike&amp;#39; or doss house, where a cup of sugary tea, a hunk of stale bread and a blanket were the only sustenance and comfort on offer.&lt;br /&gt;
George Orwell&amp;#39;s vivid memoir of his time living among the desperately poor and destitute, Down and Out in Paris and London is a moving tour of the underworld of society." />
