  <title>Borrowed Finery - Paula Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An exotic, heartbreaking memoir that should finally earn Paula Fox, a distinguished novelist and children&#39;s book writer, the audience she has for decades deserved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paula Fox has long been acclaimed as one of America&#39;s most brilliant fiction writers. &lt;i&gt;Borrowed Finery&lt;/i&gt;, her first book in nearly a decade, is an astonishing memoir of her highly unusual beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in the twenties to nomadic, bohemian parents, Fox is left at birth in a Manhattan orphanage, then cared for by a poor yet cultivated minister in upstate New York. Her parents, however, soon resurface. Her handsome father is a hard-drinking screenwriter  who is, for young Paula, &quot;part ally, part betrayer.&quot; Her mother is given to icy bursts of temper that punctuate a deep indifference. How, Fox wonder, is this woman &quot;enough of an organic being to have carried me in her belly&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never sharing more than a few moments with his daughter, Fox&#39;s father allows her to be shunted from New York City, where she lives with her passive Spanish grandmother, to Cuba, where she roams freely on a relative&#39;s sugar-cane plantation,  to California, where she finds herself cast upon Hollywood&#39;s grubby margins. The thread binding these wanderings is the &quot;borrowed finery&quot; of the title-a few pieces of clothing, almost always lent by kind-hearted strangers,  that offer Fox a rare glimpse of permanency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivid and poetic, &lt;i&gt;Borrowed Finery&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable book which will swell the legions of Paula Fox&#39;s devoted admiriers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
