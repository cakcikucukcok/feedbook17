  <title>Delta Lady - Rita Coolidge, Michael Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The two-time Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter bares her heart and soul in this intimate memoir, a story of music, stardom, love, family, heritage, and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She inspired songs&amp;#8212;Leon Russell wrote &amp;#8220;A Song for You&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Delta Lady&amp;#8221; for her, Stephen Stills wrote &amp;#8220;Cherokee.&amp;#8221; She co-wrote songs&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;Superstar&amp;#8221; and the piano coda to &amp;#8220;Layla,&amp;#8221; uncredited. She sang backup for Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, and Stills, before finding fame as a solo artist with such hits as &amp;#8220;We&amp;#39;re All Alone&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher and Higher.&amp;#8221; Following her story from Lafayette, Tennessee to becoming one of the most sought after rock vocalists in LA in the 1970s, &lt;em&gt;Delta Lady&lt;/em&gt; chronicles Rita Coolidge&amp;#8217;s fascinating journey throughout the &amp;#8217;60s-&amp;#8217;70s pop/rock universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A muse to some of the twentieth century&amp;#8217;s most influential rock musicians, she broke hearts, and broke up bands. Her relationship with drummer Jim Gordon took a violent turn during the legendary 1970 Mad Dogs &amp;#38; Englishmen tour; David Crosby maintained that her triangle with Stills and Graham Nash was the last straw for the group. Her volatile six-year marriage to Kris Kristofferson yielded two Grammys, a daughter, and one of the Baby Boom generation&amp;#8217;s epic love stories. Throughout it all, her strength, resilience, and inner and outer beauty&amp;#8212;along with her strong sense of heritage and devotion to her family&amp;#8212;helped her to not only survive, but thrive. Co-written with best-selling author Michael Walker, &lt;em&gt;Delta Lady&lt;/em&gt; is a rich, deeply personal memoir that offers a front row seat to an iconic era, and illuminates the life of an artist whose career has helped shape modern American culture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
