  <title>We’Ll All Die as Marines - Colonel Jim Bathurst Usmc (Retired)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For seventeen-year-old high school dropout Jim Bathurst, the Marine Corpss reputation for making men out of boys was something he desperately needed when he enlisted in March of 1958. What began as a four-year hitch lasted nearly thirty-six years and included an interesting assortment of duty stations and assignments as both enlisted and officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Well All Die As Marines&lt;/i&gt; narrates a story about a young, free-spirited kid from Dundalk, Maryland, and how the Corps captured his body, mind, and spirit. Slowly, but persistently, the Corps transformed him into someone whose first love would forever be the United States Marine Corps. It documents not only his leadership, service, and training but also regales many tales of his fellow Marines that will have the reader laughing, cheering, and at times crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Bathurst reveals that for hima former DI who was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal with Combat V, Purple Heart, and a combat commission to second lieutenantthe Corps was not a job, a career, or even a profession; it wasand still isa way of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
