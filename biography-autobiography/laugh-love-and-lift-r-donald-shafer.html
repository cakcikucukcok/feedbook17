  <title>Laugh, Love, and Lift - R. Donald Shafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;R. Donald Shafer knows life is a story and that all of our stories are different.  This memoir spans seven decades of his life as a son, brother, friend, husband, father, pastor, bishop, church administrator, and grandfather.  Shafer chronologically and topically narrates his unique journey with the hope that his stories will encourage others to look up, laugh, love, and ultimately lift their spirits to accept all that life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafer begins with his birth in a little Pennsylvania village where he tells of peaceful times growing up near his grandparents.  With four siblings, caring parents, an affirming pastor, and fascinating neighbors, life is exciting.  During his adolescence Shafer decides to follow Jesus, a decision that changes his life forever.  Working at mowing lawns, delivering newspapers, dancing at the  high school prom, and a few car accidents are escapades of his youth.  Shafer details his college life and love stories of meeting his future wife.  Beyond his expectations, he becomes an ordained pastor, church leader, bishop, and even a public relations man.  Contemporary church planting on a shoestring and relational caring for pastors marked this church administrator&#39;s career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laugh, Love, and Lift&lt;/i&gt; shares one man&#39;s uplifting journey through life as he discovers the importance of loving relationships, unyielding faith, and hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
