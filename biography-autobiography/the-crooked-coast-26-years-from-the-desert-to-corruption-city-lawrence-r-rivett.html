  <title>The Crooked Coast  26 Years from the Desert to Corruption City - Lawrence R Rivett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This story is about exposing the corruption that is rampant in Australia. As I prove in the book, everybody has their price. This story shows Australia to be a very violent country even today and tells how the gangs in the cities and the country can plot your downfall and how the establishments play their part to bring it about (read all about how they are more rotting to the core the further up the tree you go). I can prove a certain state in Australia has no law, only gangland law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story rolls on from the deserts of Australia from an early career supplying the meat trade. This part will appeal to rural Australia to starting a small business in the city to the best state to live in and gold, prospecting also my experiences with Australia&#39;s allusive black panthers, which I have given my opinions and some evidence while I lived amongst them. When I was prospecting in Australia, I had a lot of evidence of corruption in Australia. I also offered my opinions on a lot of issues, photos of lots of gold nuggets, and suggestions on how to drive correctly and reduce the road toll, as well as suggestions on how to keep the coppers off the individual&#39;s back (lone men).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A must read for even those on the inside and the majority who are on the outside. Also read about my harrowing experiences with Australia&#39;s black panthers and how I am looking forward to more of them through to final eventual discovery of the animal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
