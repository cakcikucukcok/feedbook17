  <title>A Dialogue with My Soul - Roger Mahloch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This very inspirational book is more than a simple memoir--it is his ethical will. The author relates how events and circumstances in his life have influenced him to be the man he is. It truly is a dialogue with his soul as he contemplates just what are the values that have been the guiding principles of his life  and what happenings throughout his life were shaped by and did also shape his moral compass. Reading his ethical will imparts encouragement to everyone to consider the value of embarking on this endeavor. A question we all at sometime ask ourselves is  what is really important and what kind of legacy do I want to leave? Passing on his sincere thoughts, values and beliefs abrogates the interpretation of them by others. His ethical will reflects the voice of his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in rural Nebraska on a farm without indoor plumbing at the end of the Depression, served in the US Navy, and after a long and highly successful career in business and followed then with a diagnosis of cancer, he decided to stop and have literally a dialogue with his soul. And through that searching for his real self, which he so beautifully relates, gained a clearer perspective on his life as he lived it in the past and continues in the present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a delightful entrepreneurial bent beyond his big corporation life with some successes  and yes, some non-success stories. He loved to be busy with remodeling projects in every house they lived in as he and his wife moved around the country frequently on his rapid moving up the corporate ladder. And what fun stories some of these are. He always has had an overriding can-do drive and coupled with a love for treating others well and honestly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all can see ourselves many, many times throughout this wonderful book. And reading his Dialogue With My Soul hopefully will help the reader to also have such a dialogue create their ethical will, and gain the blessings it has meant to him and his loved ones. &lt;/p&gt;" />
