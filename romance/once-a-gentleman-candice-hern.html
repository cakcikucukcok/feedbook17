  <title>Once a Gentleman - Candice Hern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When two friends are found in a compromising situation, their marriage of convenience turns into something neither was looking for ... and something neither can live without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholas Parrish wakes one morning to pounding at the front door of his London townhouse. Standing before him is the irate father of Prudence Armitage and several of her scowling brothers. They accuse him of compromising Prudence, and to his astonishment the woman in question walks out of his study, looking as if she&#39;s just been roused from her bed! Prudence had a tiring night putting the finishing touches to &lt;em&gt;The Ladies&#39; Fashionable Cabinet&lt;/em&gt;, the magazine she and Nicholas, along with his sister Edwina, have been working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Edwina on an extended wedding trip, Prudence had wanted everything to be perfect. But she fell asleep at her desk, and when she walks out of the office and sees her family ready to murder the man she had secretly had a crush on, Prudence is appalled. And when a marriage is forced between them, she is devastated. The damage is done, though, and now she&#39;s determined to make things right between herself and her new husband . . . by making him fall in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
