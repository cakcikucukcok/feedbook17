      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A &quot;heartbreaking, heartwarming&quot; (Heidi McLaughlin, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author) love story that asks the question: what do you do when your soul mate marries your best friend?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If you&#39;re Kate Evans, you keep your friend Rachel, bond with her kids, and bury your feelings for her husband. The fact that Shane&#39;s in the military and away for long periods helps-but when tragedy strikes, everything changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After Rachel, pregnant with her fourth child, dies in a car accident and the baby miraculously survives, Kate upends her entire life to share parenting duties. Then on the first anniversary of Rachel&#39;s death, Kate and Shane take comfort in each other in a night that they both soon regret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Shane&#39;s been angry for a year, and now he feels guilty too - for sleeping with his wife&#39;s best friend and liking it . . . liking her. Kate&#39;s ability to read him like a book may have once sent Shane running, but their lives are forever entwined and they are growing closer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now with Shane deployed for seven months, Kate is on her own and struggling with being a single parent. Shane is loving and supportive from thousands of miles away, but his homecoming brings a betrayal Kate never saw coming. So Kate&#39;s only choice is to fight for the future she deserves - with or without Shane. . ." />
