  <title>Finally We Are Here - Angelo Grassia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After the great success obtained with &amp;rdquo;The mystery of the book&amp;rdquo;, Angelo Grassia returns with his second book, a story full of mystery, love and feelings. &amp;rdquo;Finally we are here&amp;rdquo; is the continuation of &amp;rdquo;The mystery of the book&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laura, a beautiful girl with green eyes, after reading &amp;rdquo;The mystery of the book&amp;rdquo;, impressed by the story decides to contact the author for more information. The two meet at the Bar Bazzanti in Gaeta, the same Bar where last year he had known Sabrina, another beautiful girl with green eyes. Laura tells she was fascinated by the story, and she bought from the same second-hand dealer a ring belonging to Claudia and also a postcard Vittorio had sent just before they became husband and wife. This was the last postcard left. The only one missing from Angelo`s collection. Laura shows it to him and Angelo is impressed. He thinks it was Fate who sent Laura with that postcard and the message written on it was directed to him. On the postcard there was written: Finally we are... with love, Vittorio. From this message Angelo understands it is now time to publish the entire manuscript of Vittorio, he had received as a gift the year before from a junk dealer never seen before. The manuscript tells about the mutual feelings between father and son, and about the beautiful love story between Vittorio and Claudia, they were engaged to meet in a street in Como called &amp;rdquo;the street of the stars&amp;rdquo;, where the stars , in fact, with their magical splendour they seemed to be whispering: &amp;rdquo;Love yourselves... The best thing in life is love!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
