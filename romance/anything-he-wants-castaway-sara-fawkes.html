      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A powerful billionaire who always gets what he wants.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;An innocent protégée who will explore the darkest reaches of her own desire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Experience their intoxicating tale-now available for the first time as a complete saga...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anything He Wants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy Delacourt&#39;s temp position isn&#39;t quite her dream job but it pays the bills. The highlight of her day is riding the elevator in the mornings with a handsome stranger. But everything changes when the stranger seduces her. Completely out of character, she yields without a fight, but she has no idea her wanton acts with a man whose name she doesn&#39;t know will change her life forever. Because the sexy stranger is none other than Jeremiah Hamilton, billionaire CEO of Hamilton Industries, and one taste isn&#39;t nearly enough to satisfy his need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Castaway&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the billionaire pulls Lucy deeper into his world of high stakes business deals and ruthless takeovers, he demands nothing less than her complete surrender. But Jeremiah has no place in his life for love, and as Lucy falls deeper for him, she risks having her heart shattered. Making matters worse, Jeremiah&#39;s fiercest rival is determined to steal Lucy&#39;s affection...and to do it, he&#39;ll show her the sinister side of Jeremiah&#39;s opulent world. With nowhere to turn and no one to trust, there&#39;s only one thing Lucy knows for sure: she&#39;ll never be free from Jeremiah&#39;s sweet possession. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Smoking HOT! Full of secrets, lust, domination, romance, danger and action. There is so much to like!&quot; &lt;i&gt;-Crazy Four Books&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
