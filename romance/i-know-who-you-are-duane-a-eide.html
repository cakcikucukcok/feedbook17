  <title>I Know Who You Are - Duane A. Eide</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ten year old Denten Ballery, on a Saturday morning bike ride through a community park, hears a soft plea for help. Parked just off the trail on which he rides, sits a big black car nearly concealed by park trees. Peering out the back window are two large dark eyes. Beyond the eyes Denten glimpses a small blonde head. Fearful he has intruded on someones privacy, he quickly rides home but tells no one what he has seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, he inadvertently meets Cayla Finch, a resident of the small rural town that has been Dentens home all his life. Cayla, also, has lived in this rural Minnesota town most of her life. However, she attended a private school while Denten attended the public school. They had never met before an accidental meeting in a popular local bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, their relationship evolves to the point where intimacy would be expected. At this time, both Denten and Cayla discover a shocking truth, one that could have devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;" />
