  <title>Life Lived Twice - Sherrie Wouters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some promises are made to last forever... What if you fell in love with a stranger ... but that stranger had come from your past, a past you never knew existed until the moment your eyes met? When Tess Winters locks eyes with a stranger at an airport bookstore, it ignites a feeling of passion somewhere deep inside her that she can&amp;#39;t explain. Although the encounter is innocent and brief, the intensity of it lingers, leaving her overwhelmed by a yearning for the mystery man now consuming her every thought. Struggling to break the powerful hold he has over her heart, Tess starts to experience strange but familiar dreams...dreams from the turn of the twentieth century of the charming Mr Addison Taylor. As her dreams start to materialize into reality, and past and present begin to blur, Tess is forced to put the pieces of a forgotten time together, and soon discovers that love isn&amp;#39;t the only thing that can find you after an eternity. Captivating, mysterious, and romantic, Life Lived Twice will leave you wondering whether love is so powerful it could last more than a lifetime&lt;/p&gt;" />
