  <title>The Virgin and the Viscount - Charis Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Virgin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Elisabeth Hamilton-Baythes has a painful secret. At fifteen, she was abducted by highwaymen and sold to a brothel. But two days later, she was rescued by a young lord, a man she&amp;#8217;s never forgotten. Now, she&amp;#8217;s devoted herself to save other innocents from a similar fate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Viscount&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryson Courtland, Viscount Rainsleigh, never breaks the rules. Well, once, but that was a long time ago. He&amp;#8217;s finally escaped his unhappy past to become one of the wealthiest noblemen in Britain. The last thing he needs to complete his ideal life? A perfectly proper wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unraveling &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bryson and Elisabeth meet, he sees only a flawless candidate for his future wife. But a distant memory calls to him every time he&amp;#8217;s with her. Elisabeth knows she&amp;#8217;s not the wife Bryson needs, and he is the only person who has the power to reveal her secret. But neither can resist the devastating pull of attraction, and as the truth comes to light, they must discover that an improper love is the truest of all. &lt;/p&gt;" />
