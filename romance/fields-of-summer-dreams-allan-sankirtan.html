  <title>Fields of Summer Dreams - Allan Sankirtan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If life is just a dream, can you change &lt;/br&gt;
your life plan with awareness? &lt;/br&gt;
Can you change the pastor the future? &lt;/br&gt;
What if you knew the key to turn your &lt;/br&gt;
Dreams into your living reality? &lt;/p&gt;
Lost in a beautiful, lush garden, in a seductive and alluring dream, two young lovers meetand discover the miracle that allows them to bring their love story to the real world: to make their dreams, quite literally, their living reality. &lt;/p&gt;
In this, the sequel to Dreams with Dreams, Aidan and Effie confront their promises, their hopes, and their waking dreams for the futureand everything they think they know about themselves. Can they agree to change the dream with conscious awareness and write a new life planor are they fated to play out a script they have no conscious say in, blindly playing out the roles of their lives with unawareness? &lt;/p&gt;
Can Aidan and Effie learn to interact consciously with other aspects of their total personality focused in alternate and parallel realities? Can they remember promises once made and consciously agree to explore them in a new way, thus reshaping both their so-called past and future? &lt;/p&gt;
Can they use this information consciously to refocus their lives, thus realizing the inner blueprint of all they can possibly be? &lt;/p&gt;
Allan Sankirtans lifelong interest in dream interpretation and the symbology underpinning language, pictographs, and sacred art inspires his fiction. He currently lives in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;" />
