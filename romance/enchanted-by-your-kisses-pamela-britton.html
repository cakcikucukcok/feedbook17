  <title>Enchanted By Your Kisses - Pamela Britton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;His Plan Was Seduction...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proud and beautiful Lady Ariel D&#39;Archer bravely bears the cruel disdain of society -- all the while wondering if her sullied reputation will prevent love from ever entering her heart again. But then she meets Nathan Trevain, whose breathtaking gaze inflames her passion and whose softest touch sets her heated blood racing. This is a man unwilling to take &quot;no&quot; for an answer -- nor is Ariel certain she could deny him anything. But he is also a man who harbors a dangerous secret -- one that places Ariel in grave danger once she uncovers it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Destiny Was Surrender&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secretive future Duke of Davenport has his own hidden reasons for wanting to help the exquisite fallen rose restore her good name -- and for taking her prisoner once she discovers his true identity. For his lovely captive holds the key to the fate of his lost brother. And it will take every ounce of Trevain&#39;s fabled seductive powers to win her help. But the closer he holds her -- the deeper he kisses her -- the more completely the lady Ariel takes possession of his soul. Will she be the one to seduce him with true love -- the sweetest, most succulent magic of all?&lt;/p&gt;" />
