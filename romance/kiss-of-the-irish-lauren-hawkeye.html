  <title>Kiss of the Irish - Lauren Hawkeye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If Sarah Mercer had ever been asked to describe herself in one word, it would be sensible. After all, she had a steady job. Made prudent decisions. Was in what she though was a logical relationship. But when her fiance dumps her for an exotic dancer, Sarah decides it&#39;s time to change...everything! The first thing on her agenda? To get out of town and take a three month trip to Ireland. She&#39;d always been captivated by the Emerald Isle. And she&#39;d heard that there was nothing like an Irishman with a sexy accent and eyes as devastatingly green as the country&#39;s rolling hills to make a girl feel better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But maybe she shouldn&#39;t have hooked up with her new landlord on the first night in town. Cian Murphy wasn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to be her type. His arms and chest were tattooed, and he had piercings everywhere. Still, he made her feel beautiful, sexy...alive for the first time in years. Falling for the Irish hottie was as natural as breathing. But figuring out what she&#39;d do when it came time to leave? Not so easy...&lt;/p&gt;" />
