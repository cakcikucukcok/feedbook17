          &lt;strong&gt;A test of passion…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dione Williams knew what it was like to be young and pregnant with nowhere to go. Years later, through hard work and sheer force of will, she had provided a good life for her daughter and started a successful home for teenage mothers and their babies. But from the moment television producer Garrett Lawrence began a story on the teen center, Dione&#39;s hard-won confidence was shaken. How could a man she found so attractive and intelligent be so cynical about unwed mothers? Battling her conflicted emotions, Dione would have to defend the work she believed in–even if it cost her a love that promised a lifetime of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A test of love…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Garrett didn&#39;t think much of &quot;irresponsible&quot; teen mothers. He knew firsthand the misery of being given away and searching for the acceptance he never could seem to find. Although he found himself drawn closer and closer to Dione because of her independence and passionate determination, his painful past kept getting in the way. Now Garrett and Dione must find their way to each other through a search only the heart can undertake–and only love can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
