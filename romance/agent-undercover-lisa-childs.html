But that&#39;s where he tracks down Claire Molenski, a computer programmer suspected of selling government information. When he rescues her from a botched kidnapping, he realizes not only that she&#39;s innocent, but also that the only way to protect her is to pose as her boyfriend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Claire knows that their relationship is a ruse. Once the case is closed, she&#39;ll never see Ash again, and that scares her almost as much as the abduction attempts. But the way he acts toward her makes her wonder just how much of an act their relationship really is. And if she&#39;ll be able to survive long enough to find out." />
