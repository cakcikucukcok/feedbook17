          &lt;strong&gt;A mistress to seal the deal…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Greek tycoon Alekos Gionakis thought he knew the value of his secretary, but her newly transformed appearance – and surprising secret parentage – has him reappraising his most precious asset!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alekos knows that he can offer beautiful Sara Lovejoy the ability to meet her family under his protection, whilst also securing a secret deal… providing she agrees to become his mistress!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But his best plaid plans are about to go awry, because her innocence is the one thing this powerful tycoon is about to realize is priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
