  <title>Truth Is the Song - Meg Duly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The song continues as the country music duo of Marty Abby and Christopher Powell prepare for their upcoming tour. They make their four newly adopted daughters a part of the planning. Things change when their oldest daughter, born with serious birth defects, is pushed to the floor and called a freak by the school bully. The child is beyond consolation until the childrens doctor tells the family of a new technique that will straighten the little girls twisted bones and of new plastic surgery to remove her scars from a cleft palate.
These surgeries create problems with the already heavily booked, out-of-state concerts. The duos talented crew comes up with techniques to let Chris go on tour and Marty stay with their daughter during the surgeries but join him via live projection on screens set up at the different venues.
This seems to be a solution until the couple start getting threatening letters. The police officer assigned to celebrity stalkings begins work. Just before Chris is to leave for the first concert, he learns of a sting set up to capture the stalker. When he confronts the woman, she kicks him, injuring his shoulder. Marty, seeing this on TV, is very angry at his macho move. They part after a verbal fight.
For the next month, because of a great deal of misunderstanding, the couple believes their marriage is over. It isnt until the children help Marty realize that something is very wrong that she goes to him. She realizes he never knew that the woman he confronted was not the stalker. On the way home, the stalker attempts to kill them.
True identities and motives of officers assigned to protect the coupleas well as who it is that actually stopped the stalkerare revealed at that time." />
