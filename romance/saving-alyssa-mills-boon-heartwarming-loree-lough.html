  <title>Saving Alyssa (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) - Loree Lough</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;He couldn&#39;t save his wife…but he will save Alyssa&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Noah Preston entered witness protection, his only concern was for his daughter. He couldn&#39;t save her mother, but he would save Alyssa—no matter what. Now, three years later, he&#39;s done his best to make their new lives work. But he can&#39;t let go of the fear—and the guilt—that haunt him. And he can&#39;t let Alyssa out of his sight.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Noah&#39;s convinced that loneliness is part of his penance. So when Billie Landon stumbles into his bike shop, he&#39;s determined to keep his distance. He can&#39;t risk giving in to his attraction to her. Even though she could be exactly what he, and his child, really need.&lt;/p&gt;
