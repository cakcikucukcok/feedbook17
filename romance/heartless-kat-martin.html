But she couldn&#39;t foresee the earl&#39;s timely death, or her own disturbing attraction to his bastard son and heir, Justin Ross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justin never meant to demand payment from the tempting young woman his father had so callously planned to ruin. But her innocent allure provoked his ruthless nature and he vowed he would have her in his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seduction was his plan, but Justin never suspected Ariel&#39;s innocent passion would awaken emotions he had long thought dead. Now mistrust and betrayal threaten the fragile happiness the two of them have found, and Justin must convince Ariel he isn&#39;t the heartless man she believes him to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
