  <title>The Night Remembers - Kathleen Eagle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a spellbinding novel of depth and sensitivity, award-winning author Kathleen Eagle masterfully weaves the richness of Native American folklore into a contemporary story of hope, courage, and the power of love to lift the human spirit.&lt;p&gt;Angela Prescott has pulled up stakes and moved halfway across the country, seeking refuge from a man who has made her life a nightmare. Starting over in an unfamiliar city, she&#39;s wary and keeps to herself, until she meets twelve-year-old Tommy T. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Street-smart Tommy T knows how to keep secrets. He&#39;s told no one of the mysterious recluse living in an underground hideaway, whose face he&#39;s never seen. A gifted comic book artist with no place to live, Tommy T needs someone to believe in, and in this phantom stranger he finds the comic book superhero of his dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Brown Wolf&#39;s past has driven him underground in many ways. By day, he is a handsome repairman who fixes the plumbing in Angela&#39;s rooms. By night he lives in the shadows, acting with reckless bravery to make the streets safer for kids. . .and whispering into Angela&#39;s sleeping ear promises of comfort, security, and heart&#39;s ease.&lt;/p&gt;" />
