  <title>A Woman&#39;s Innocence - Gayle Callen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the final instalment of Gayle Callen&#39;s exciting Spies and Lovers trilogy, a mad&amp;#8211;dash search for truth brings together an unlikely pair &amp;#8211; a woman accused of treason, and the man who convicted her... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that he finally has the infamous traitor, Julia Reed, in jail, you would think English agent Samuel Sherryngton would be pleased to see justice served. But circumstances aren&#39;t always what they appear to be, and the facts aren&#39;t adding up. Soon Sam has doubts over her guilt which, of course, has nothing to do with the attraction for Julia he&#39;s been fighting against for so many years. Not willing to see her executed for a crime she may not have committed, Sam defies the laws of England and breaks Julia out of jail. What initially began as a search to find proof convicting Julia quickly turns into a quest to prove her innocence. Can this bold and dashing pair discover the truth and still find time for love? &lt;/p&gt;" />
