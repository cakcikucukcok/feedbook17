  <title>An Avon True Romance: Samantha and the Cowboy - Lorraine Heath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Samantha&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she manages to get herself hired for the cattle drive, all of Samantha&#39;s prayers seem to be answered. The hundred dollars she&#39;ll earn will pull her family&#39;s Texas farm out of ruin and pay off their debts. But keeping the cowhands fooled that she&#39;s a boy becomes harder than she&#39;d expected where one cowboy in particular is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;The Cowboy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Hart wants two things: to forget the tragedies he witnessed on the front lines of the War Between the States, and to reclaim his cowboy life. The last thing he wants is the responsibility of a tagalong youngster on the cattle drive. His closed mind and hardened heart are territory best left unexplored, until a fateful moment turns his world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt discovers what and who &quot;Sam&quot; really is, and he is furious. But soon a stronger emotion takes hold, and bound by Samantha&#39;s secret, Matt is torn between revealing her identity and his own sudden and frightening love for her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
