  <title>Eternal - Sarah A. Osborne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aging at one-tenth the rate of the average human, Helena has never really understood her place in the mortal world. The first six decades of her life, she lived behind the walls of a convent, but after committing a horrendous crime, Helena is sent to a maximum security institute and spends another seven decades in solitary confinement. When she finally escapes her imprisonment, she has the physical looks of a thirteen-year-old girl but with a highly developed mental ability.
Now on the run, Helena embarks on a journey to discover more about herself but finds her abilities are far more intricate than she could ever imagine, and dealing with mortal emotions is even more strenuous than managing her insatiable urge to hunt the evil that lurks around every corner. While seeking refuge at a southern plantation, she meets an eccentric psychic, who may hold the key to Helenas past, while unintentionally falling for an exotic mortal boy with a past just as mysterious as her own. 
Unable to run from her past or mortal emotions any longer, Helena must free herself not only from her captors but also from the people she truly cares about and decide whether to keep the one person who truly makes her happy or to let him go entirely." />
