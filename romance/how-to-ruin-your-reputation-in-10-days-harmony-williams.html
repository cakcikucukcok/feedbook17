      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1814 London, England, a lady is defined as a demure, delicate flower. Miss Francine Annesley is not that lady. If men were like plants, she would have a garden of admirers to choose from instead of the thorn in her side since childhood, Julian Beckwith. But she would make an even worse nun than she does a lady, which will be her fate if she can&#39;t dig up a husband before the Season ends. However, Julian is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With only ten short days left in the Season, Francine doesn&#39;t have time to waste on petty squabbles or knee-weakening kisses, even if Julian&#39;s offer to fulfill her every wish rouses her curiosity. It seems men are more complicated than plants. Too bad love bloomed at the most inconvenient of times...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Ladies of Passion series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 How to Play the Game of Love&lt;br&gt;Book #2 How to Ruin Your Reputation in 10 Days&lt;/p&gt;" />
