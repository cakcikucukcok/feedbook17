  <title>The Bachelor Auction - Rachel Van Dyken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cinderella never had to deal with this crap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Jane isn&#39;t entirely sure that Cinderella got such a raw deal. Sure, she had a rough start, but didn&#39;t she eventually land a prince and a happily-ever-after? Meanwhile, Jane is busy waiting on her demanding, entitled sisters, running her cleaning business, and . . . yep, not a prince in sight. Until a party and a broken shoe incident leave Jane wondering if princes---or at least, a certain deliciously hunky billionaire --maybe &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Except Brock Wellington isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s dream guy. Hell, a prince would &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; agree to be auctioned off in marriage to the highest bidder. Or act like an arrogant jerk---even if it was just a favßade. Now, as Brock is waiting for the auction chopping block, he figures it&#39;s karmic retribution that he&#39;s tempted by a sexy, sassy woman he can&#39;t have. But while they can&#39;t have a fairy-tale ending, maybe they can indulge in a little bit of fantasy . . ." />
