  <title>One Week to Win Her Boss - Barbara White Daille</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Single mom Amber Barnett loves family, kids, Christmas...and unfortunately, her boss, confirmed bachelor Michael DeFranco. It&#39;s a crush she really needs to get over. Except, when she&#39;s temporarily forced from her apartment, her only option is to stay at Michael&#39;s private ski lodge, where she&#39;s the housekeeper. No problem. Her handsome boss rarely visits Snowflake Valley unexpectedly, plus he&#39;s spending the holidays with his family. Or so she thinks...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A stormy Christmas Eve reunion leaves Michael seeking the solitude of his lodge, where he finds Amber in residence--and in trouble. Attempting to save her from her matchmaking family, he announces they&#39;re a couple. His good deed backfires when they&#39;re instantly included in each and every holiday event in town. So much for solitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the more time he spends with the beautiful, cheery brunette, the more he yearns to make things real between them. But he and Amber want different things, and Michael could never be the family man she&#39;s looking for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Snowflake Valley series is a STANDALONE story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;* Snowbound with Mr. Wrong&lt;br&gt;* One Week to Win Her Boss&lt;/p&gt;" />
