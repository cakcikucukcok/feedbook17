      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Highlander Harrison MacMasters knows a pretty face can hide bitter deception. Once, he&#39;d been drawn to Grace Winters and the temptation in her kiss. Now, he knows better than to trust her with anything, including his heart. But when he&#39;s drawn into a risky mission with life-and-death stakes, he&#39;s forced to watch over the one woman he hoped to never see again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grace Winters will do anything to keep her sister safe, even if it means stealing the Crown Jewels themselves. But when she&#39;s caught in the act, she&#39;ll need to make a bargain with the devil to keep herself from the gallows and her family from the poorhouse. Too bad the one man she gave in to temptation with years ago now controls her fate and is playing a dangerous game of his own--with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Highland Hearts series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The Highlander Who Loved Me&lt;br&gt;* Lady Evelyn&#39;s Highland Protector&lt;br&gt;* Tempting the Highland Spy&lt;/p&gt;" />
