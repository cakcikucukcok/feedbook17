  <title>Promise of Passion - Barbara Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Sea is deep and mysterious, the spectacular home to the romantic Greek Isles and more. When Demetri Papas, an extremely handsome and complicated Greek, meets Kristen Johnston, a beautiful, young, American coed, the magic of the region sweeps them into a deep love. Their future seems to shine as brightly as the Mediterranean sun itself  until the clouds sweep in and trouble looms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demetris past is one filled with a shocking darkness that he has worked passionately to leave behind him. But when his lover accidentally betrays his confidence, old enemies and associates encroach upon their new love with devastating consequences. Torn apart by fate and necessity, the lovers spend three decades apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an accidental meeting reunites them thirty years later, they discover that their feelings for one another remain unchanged by the years. Demetri is still haunted by the crimes and connections of his past, which have coerced him into service again. He is tasked with smuggling a precious icon out of the countryand he needs Kristens help. Now a successful physician with a stable life, her morality is put to the test. But at great risk, her love for Demetri compels her to help him escape these people once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this dangerous quest for his freedom, they must find the way to forge a new relationship if they hope to bring the flames of passion from their past into their new future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
