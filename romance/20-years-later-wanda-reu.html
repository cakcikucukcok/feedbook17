  <title>20 Years Later - Wanda Reu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arabia held a mysterious power that pulled individuals to the hot sands of the Middle East. Where else could one find the beautiful Arabian horses that could take one flying across the sands? Where else did people live in their beautifully decorated tent dwellings and plan Jihad for their enemies?
James was a young American boy who had been trained by his familys Arabian servant and friend to one day go to Arabia to live. That desire grew inside James as James grew to become a man. 
Most who were drawn to Arabia had no idea of the cost Arabia could exact from you. It could even demand your life. 
There was much treachery in Arabia because of the lust for power. This was even true in ones own family, as family members were killed to prevent them from rising to power. 
What was it that drew the heart of James La Faye? Was it a lust for personal power, or was it a desire to see the heart of Arabia changed toward the people of America? Would there always be the hatred and mistrust between the two worlds?" />
