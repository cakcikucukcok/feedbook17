  <title>Clandestine Affairs of the Heart - James R. Youngblood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Roberts comes from a long line of naval officers. He has been groomed since birth to serve his country honorably, and as a Navy SEAL, he does not disappoint. Driven to succeed, he is assigned to the CIA in Afghanistan, where he accomplishes more than anyone could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He assumes an Arab name and poses as a Saudi so he can infiltrate Taliban territory to gather intelligence. Over the next three years, he earns two Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars, the Navy Cross, and the Congressional Medal of Honor. Even so, something is missing from his life. He has two affairs to fill the void: one with Sue Walker and another with Becky Simon.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sue ends up getting married, but soon Jonathan hears Becky will be back in his life, working nearby. Is this a sign? Has he found a woman to love? Jonathans destiny is unclear. He feels driven to serve his country, but he also dreams of being a husband and father. Is he destined to be with Becky, or is he destined to be married to his work, like so many Roberts men before him?&lt;/p&gt;" />
