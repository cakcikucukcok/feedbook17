  <title>Havoc - Jamie Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Hailey Harper left her family farm to enroll in veterinary school, she had a plan: keep her head down, ace her classes, and most importantly... don&amp;#8217;t upset the uncle paying her tuition. Translation? Don&amp;#8217;t piss off his dramatic, self-absorbed daughter, Danica, even if she&amp;#8217;s a nightmare to live with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling in love with her cousin&amp;#8217;s rock star ex-boyfriend was definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the drummer of a now-famous rock band, Mike Madden could have any girl he wants. He&amp;#8217;s sweet, funny, romantic, talented&amp;#8212;and the only guy that&amp;#8217;s ever made Hailey&amp;#8217;s heart do cartwheels in her chest. The more she gets to know him, the harder she falls, but Hailey knows they can never be more than friends&amp;#8230; because Danica wants him back, and she&amp;#8217;ll fight dirty to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike is falling for Hailey too, but Danica&amp;#8217;s threats and his rock star life&amp;#8212;music video shoots, international tours, obsessed fans&amp;#8212;could tear them apart before they&amp;#8217;ve even begun. Hailey isn&amp;#8217;t sure she&amp;#8217;s the one for him, but Mike&amp;#8217;s waited years for a girl like her&amp;#8230; and he&amp;#8217;ll do anything to prove it. &lt;/p&gt;" />
