          &lt;strong&gt;FROM A PECK ON THE CHEEK…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maddie Jackson&#39;s bruised heart leaped at the casual brush to her cheek. Evidently men in this town found her attractive! But wasn&#39;t this handsome stranger being a little forward? And then she discovered that Patrick O&#39;Rourke thought Maddie was his sister-in-law, and her heart leaped again–this time with hope….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;TO A TINGLE IN HER TOES!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because Maddie had come to town searching for family–and now she might have found a sister. Yet should she risk turmoil by getting involved with the infamous O&#39;Rourke bachelor? Though Patrick offered his support, he also stirred her vulnerable passions. Would loving him lead to heartbreak or the love and family she longed for?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There was only one way to find out…&lt;/p&gt;
