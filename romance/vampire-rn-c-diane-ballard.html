When the urge to strike out on her own calls Elizabeth to Tennessee to work on a television series, she encounters Alexander Fekete, a terrifying vampire and heavy metal musician who immediately becomes infatuated with her. But it is her relationship with actor Lars Jansson that will change everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worlds collide as Elizabeth abandons her maker and alienates her tormentor, and a doctor decides to reclaim the vampire nurse he once created.&lt;/p&gt;" />
