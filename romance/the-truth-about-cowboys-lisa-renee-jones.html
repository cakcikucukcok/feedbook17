  <title>The Truth About Cowboys - Lisa Renee Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steamy, sexy, and laugh-out-loud funny, THE TRUTH ABOUT COWBOYS is a new contemporary novel that will pull your heartstrings and steam up your e-reader...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was off pitching in the big leagues, my family was back in the small town of Sweetwater, Texas, running the family ranch. Then tragedy hit and I discovered there were secrets that my family kept, problems they hid. I went home, left behind the money, women, and fame. I took over the ranch and took care of my grandmother. I took over hiding the secrets. Then &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; came to town. A smart-mouthed, clumsy, too-smart-and-too-pretty-for-my-own-good city girl hiding out to write a book. She&#39;s right here, on my property, in the cottage my grandmother rented her without my permission, and she sees too much. She knows too much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now suddenly my world is spinning, and she&#39;s shoving a baseball back in my hand while baking cookies with my grandmother. She&#39;s the devil and an angel all in one fiery little package. I decide I&#39;ll wait her out. She&#39;ll go back to the city. Only suddenly I don&#39;t want her to leave, and everything I&#39;ve settled for in my life isn&#39;t enough. I want to play ball and I want her, but there&#39;s that secret that won&#39;t let go, but neither will she.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Texas Heat series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The Truth About Cowboys&lt;br&gt;* Tangled Up In Christmas&lt;/p&gt;" />
