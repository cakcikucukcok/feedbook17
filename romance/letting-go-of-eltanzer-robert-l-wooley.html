  <title>Letting Go of Eltanzer - Robert L. Wooley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a boy grows into a man in the eastern forest, he discovers he can visualize things and even create imaginary people. Guided by a restless spirit, the man decides to travel to the American West where he observes the Grand Tetons and the desert, climbs the Rocky Mountains, and stares into the Grand Canyon. Although he falls for the grandeur, he cannot forget his former lovethe quiet but stunning beauty of the East. It is a dilemma that often drives him crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the man finally takes the recommendation of an imaginary friend to embark on a healing journey to release his prejudices and fears and let things happen as they should, he closes the door on his Wyoming cabin and heads on a quest for peace. But when a beautiful angel suddenly emerges from the river and hops into his beat-up truck, the man soon discovers that the angel, Eltanzer, is there to teach him a valuable lesson about letting go and accepting change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting Go of Eltanzer explores the phenomenon of what happens when a man leaves his beloved home to explore the world, realizes his heart is torn by his love for two very different places, and must learn to heal with help from unlikely friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
