  <title>Little Criminals with Big Hearts - Luella Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LITTLE CRIMINALS WITH BIG HEARTS was written by author Luella Thomas. She was inspired to write this book based on her personal and professional experiences working as a Youth Counselor through her church organization in Southwest Michigan. It tells the story about a teenage boy who is arrested and placed in a juvenile detention center for fighting. While there, he crosses paths with kids whove been abused, abandoned, neglected, and have ran away from home. Others are there for fighting, domestic violence, violating court orders, using drugs or alcohol, and for committing crimes. It will undoubtedly change his life forever. &lt;br /&gt;
The story demonstrates how kids will embrace self-respect and respect for others, when raised or placed, in an environment that provides discipline, structure, and guidance. Additionally, it homes in on the power of love, lies, loyalty, influence, and truth. Although some characters in this story will go on to live productive and successful lives, others will not be so lucky. They will unfortunately be sent to jail or prison, and others will die at an early age. &lt;br /&gt;
Some incidents in this story are based on true events, while others are fictional. The names were created through the authors mind in an effort to bring the story together. A local book-club in Austin, Texas, states Little Criminals with Big Hearts is a heart-felt romantic-drama that will make you smile, cry, and empathize with its characters. Although this story was written to entertain, it was also written to enlighten parents and all adults about the importance of improving their relationships with children, starting with their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
