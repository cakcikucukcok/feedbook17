  <title>Love in Metro - Pratyush Sinha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ego and anger kill love. When a negatively emotional person meets a hardheaded one, fireworks are bound to happen.
Arjun was an emotional person. He always looked at the world with his own perspective. He expected from others, and when things didnt go his way, he felt bad about them. Sanjana, on the other hand, was a strong girl. She had her own way of living, never liking being pushed to a corner. It was difficult for her to bend if she was not wrong. Emotional she was, but her emotions were also for herself. She wanted her own space and wanted others to understand her.
Their anger and ego were killing whatever they had between them. Was tit for tat really needed? Life would have been so different if the anger would have been answered with love, happiness, and joy. If one person is angry, is it necessary to return the favor with anger? Life gave them a choice, it was up to them what they would do out of it. The realization of how important the other person was in their life happened only after they lost what they hadwell, almost. Was giving back so important?" />
