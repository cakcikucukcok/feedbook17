  <title>Why Earls Fall in Love - Manda Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Society often makes strange bedfellows--and even more surprising betrothals...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;IS IT A REASON FOR ROMANCE?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Why Earls Fall in Love &lt;/i&gt;by Manda Collins, young widowed Georgina Mowbray is settling into her role as Lady Russell&#39;s companion quite well--until the lady&#39;s nephew Dominic, the Earl of Coniston, arrives in Bath for a visit. Georgie&#39;s always found him shallow and too smooth, and trusts him as much as she trusts most men...which is to say, not at all. But Con turns out to be more intriguing than she remembers--and completely irresistible... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OR A PROMISE OF PASSION?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pretty, practical Georgie is nothing like the women Con usually woos--especially since she seems blind to his charms. But his elderly aunt is so fond of her that Con is determined at least to be sociable...with the occasional flirtation thrown in just for fun. But things take a serious turn when a dangerous figure from Georgie&#39;s unhappy past appears and threatens to bring her harm. Con will do whatever it takes to keep Georgie safe. And if he can show her that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; men are not menaces, he might be able to keep her in his arms and never let go...  &lt;b&gt;&quot;Absolutely delightful...an emotion-packed, passionate historical romance.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;--Romance Junkies&lt;/i&gt;, five stars (on &lt;i&gt;How to Romance a Rake&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;" />
