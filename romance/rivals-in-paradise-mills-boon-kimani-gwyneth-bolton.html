  <title>Rivals in Paradise (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) - Gwyneth Bolton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Cicely Stevens needs the vacation of a lifetime. After being cheated on by her boyfriend and passed over for a promotion, she&#39;s off to the Caribbean for a weekend of hot island fun. And there&#39;s no sexier bad boy than her old college rival Chase Yearwood, who&#39;s on the same plane en route to his lush estate…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and whose kiss Cicely never forgot. When he takes her in his arms again, he&#39;s more irresistible than ever. But will she lose her heart before this fling is flung?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They call him the &quot;Wolf&quot; because of his legendary skills in the boardroom–and the bedroom. Now is Chase&#39;s chance to even the score with the woman who once beat him at his own game. But can rivals in business become passionate partners in love? Under a romantic tropical moon, he&#39;ll seduce her with a passion that will have her begging for more!&lt;/p&gt;
