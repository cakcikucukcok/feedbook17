  <title>The Matchmaker - Rexanne Becnel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the journal of Miss Olivia Byrde:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lord H...Drinks too much. Ill-mannered and altogether too bold. Though rough-edged, he is tall and reasonably handsome. But he proves the rule that looks can be deceiving.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ill-suited for marriage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her entry into society three years ago, Olivia has kept detailed notes on every eligible man with whom she&#39;s ever sipped a cup of tea or twirled across the dance floor. Some of her diary entries have resulted in successful matches for her friends, but she&#39;s never found any man she considered remotely suitable for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once Lord Neville Hawke comes into her life, the other men in her book look positively perfect. Neville&#39;s a notorious scoundrel with a shady and painful past, and a penchant for destroying rooms in fits of drunken rage. A heartbreaker and a rogue, Lord Hawke is the kind of man who knows how to seduce a woman with only his taunting eyes and challenging words. The kind of man to whom a well-bred lady like Olivia is quite definitely immune. Until he kisses her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in that kiss he lets her know she is his salvation. With each caress he dares her to stop looking in her book and start listening to her heart. For two very stubborn souls have just found their perfect match...&lt;/p&gt;" />
