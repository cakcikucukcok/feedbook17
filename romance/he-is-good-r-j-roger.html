  <title>He is Good - R.J Roger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He is Good&lt;/em&gt; is a work of fiction. It captures love and infidelity from the mind state of a man who is living with the pains of professional failure while trapped in an emotionally intense love affair. He is a writer. His works have yet to transcend, failing to attain the success that he had anticipated. He shares the reasoning behind his wrongdoings with the women tied into his affair, his best friend, and his therapist. However, feeling misunderstood and grieving over the pain that he has caused himself and others to feel, he is trapped in guilt and incapable of escaping the mental suffering that he has brought upon himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A love story at its core, &lt;em&gt;He is Good&lt;/em&gt; is written absent of a plot, narrator, or characters. It is the story of one man and his agony. Told in the most simplistic writing style, the author attempts to move readers by their heart rather than their mind, and open their eyes to see that &lt;em&gt;He &lt;/em&gt;and all, is good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
