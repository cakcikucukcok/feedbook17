  <title>Catherine - Rone Percy Travaggin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Catherine, a beautiful and dreamy Syrian dancer, lives with her parents, Giuseppe and Beatrice, and her two sisters in a country in conflict. She is in love with Massimo, a writer in the ascendant, who is forced to flee the country. To save his son&#39;s life and rebuild her own, she becomes submissive to a famous tenor from Italy. When the reader least expects the twist of fortune, she finds her great love, Massimo, and together they unravel the mysteries of a bewildered and sweet romance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Catherine is a brilliant romance story beautifully written by actor and writer Ronny Travaggyn. As an artist, I see how creatively and with great details he worked in this book. In &#39;Defrosting Sea,&#39; an artwork of mine, I show the contrast between the bright colors and the cold, snowy atmosphere. With his artistic and literary talent, Ronny describes the contrast between culture, religion, and the &#39;mysteries of a bewildered and sweet romance.&#39;&quot; Catherine is a true masterpiece. &lt;br&gt;
(Sonny, USA) 
&lt;P&gt;&quot;In war and terror. There is hope, art, and peace. Who wins is love!&quot; &lt;br&gt;
(Luana Imperio, So Paulo, Brazil) 
&lt;P&gt;&quot;It is a controversial of universal comtemporary literature work and obvioulsy there will be opposing opinions regarding mainly to Islam, with differing religious views in each country. Well put into novel form of theater by talented author and close friend Rone Travaggyn. It intrigues moments full of choices and reflection on the conflicts of everyday life, assistig in relatiosnhips between couples, parents, children, friends and faith. &lt;br&gt;
(Dr. Ulisses Goulart Gonalves de Souza, So Paulo, Brazil) 
&lt;P&gt;&quot;My wife loved this book, is more motivated and happy. This novel deserves to be tasted by the families of the whole world&quot;&lt;br&gt;
