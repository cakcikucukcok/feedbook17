  <title>One Night with the CEO - Mia Sosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This debut romance sparkles.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Unbuttoning the CEO&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  TWO TICKETS TO PARADISE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After some disappointing dates, Karen Ramirez has concluded that great sex is for &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; people. Especially since medical school won&#39;t leave her much time for romance anyway. Then she runs into tall, dark, charming, and ridiculously wealthy Mark Lansing--and quickly reconsiders celibacy. Adding to temptation? Mark will be the best man at her sister&#39;s wedding and the nuptial destination is sultry Puerto Rico. Now this trip might just be sensory overload--or the perfect chance for Karen to find the groove she&#39;s never had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  For CEO Mark Lansing, his perfect match would be smart, sweet, and funny, with long legs and silky hair the color of dark chocolate. In short, someone a lot like Karen. But Mark&#39;s looking to settle down, while a relationship is the last thing on Karen&#39;s mind. So Mark proposes a plan: he and Karen will use their weekend in paradise to sizzling advantage--before downshifting to friendship. The only problem? Karen is all Mark can think of when he gets home. Now his most challenging negotiation will be for the one thing money &lt;i&gt;can&#39;t&lt;/i&gt; buy . . .&lt;br&gt;" />
