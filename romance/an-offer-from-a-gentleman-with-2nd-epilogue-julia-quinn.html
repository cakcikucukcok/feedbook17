  <title>An Offer From a Gentleman With 2nd Epilogue - Julia Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sophie Beckett never dreamed she&amp;#39;d be able to sneak into Lady Bridgerton&amp;#39;s famed masquerade ball&amp;#8212;or that &amp;#34;Prince Charming&amp;#34; would be waiting there for her! Though the daughter of an earl, Sophie has been relegated to the role of servant by her disdainful stepmother. But now, spinning in the strong arms of the debonair and devastatingly handsome Benedict Bridgerton, she feels like royalty. Alas, she knows all enchantments must end when the clock strikes midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who was that extraordinary woman?&lt;/em&gt; Ever since that magical night, a radiant vision in silver has blinded Benedict to the attractions of any other&amp;#8212;except, perhaps, this alluring and oddly familiar beauty dressed in housemaid&amp;#39;s garb whom he feels compelled to rescue from a most disagreeable situation. He has sworn to find and wed his mystery miss, but this breathtaking maid makes him weak with wanting her. Yet, if he offers her his heart, will Benedict sacrifice his only chance for a fairy tale love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
