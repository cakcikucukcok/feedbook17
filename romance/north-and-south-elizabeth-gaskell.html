With Wives and Daughters (1865) and Cranford (1853), it is one of her best-known novels and was adapted for television three times (1966, 1975 and 2004). The 2004 version renewed interest in the novel and attracted a wider readership.<br /><b><i>North and South (Gaskell novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | North and South, Elizabeth Gaskell North and South is a social novel published in 1854 by British writer Elizabeth Gaskell. Eighteen-year-old Margaret Hale lived for almost 10 years in London with her cousin Edith and her wealthy aunt Shaw, but when Edith marries Captain Lennox, Margaret happily returns home to the southern village of Helstone.<br /><b><i>North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell - Goodreads</i></b> | "North and South" is relatively obscure, compared to works by the Brontes or Jane Austen. That's a shame, because Elizabeth Gaskell's story can be considered as gripping and romantic as theirs -- a love that has to triumph over snobbery, class differences, prejudice and the whole weird situation with Margaret's brother.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>North and South - Elizabeth Gaskell</a> </h3></p><hr/>
