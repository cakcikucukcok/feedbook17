  <title>The Scars Between Us - MK Schiller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emma Cooper is determined to fulfill her mother&#39;s dying wish to scatter her ashes with Aiden Sheffield in Linx, Texas. Just one problem. Why Texas and who the hell is Aiden Sheffield? The only clue is a faded piece of her mother&#39;s stationary. Emma imagines Aiden is a former love of her mother&#39;s, but when she meets the beautiful, damaged stranger, she realizes her assumptions couldn&#39;t be more wrong. He&#39;s hot and young. And Emma is as confused as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiden Sheffield would rather go to hell than Linx. Who does Emma think she is disrupting his carefully built life? The last thing the Marine needs is to slice open the sealed wounds of his painful past. Yet, as he gets to know the lovely Emma, a woman who manages to smile even though she&#39;s lost everything, he changes his mind. He will not let her go to hell alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither is prepared for the devastating evil waiting for them at the end of the road. It might just destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
