  <title>To the Edge - Cindy Gerard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a wealthy businessman, Jillian Kincaid grew up with bodyguards shadowing her every move-and she hated it. Now a TV anchorwoman, she refuses to let another hired thug follow her around. Not even when she begins to receive terrifying death threats. Not even when the bodyguard is the darkly seductive Nolan Garrett... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trained in Special Ops, bodyguard Nolan Garrett has been hired by Jillian&#39;s father to keep her out of danger. But it&#39;s clear from the start that Jillian isn&#39;t going to make his job easy. Far from the spoiled princess he expected, Jillian is tough, independent, and totally sexy. And she&#39;s fighting him every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jillian&#39;s stalker raises the stakes, Nolan must keep her close if he wants to keep her alive. But being so close can only turn up the heat that&#39;s been simmering between them-a heat that could explode into passion at any moment...&lt;/p&gt;" />
