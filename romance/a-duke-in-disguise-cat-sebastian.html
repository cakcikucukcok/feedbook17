  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>A Duke in Disguise - Cat Sebastian</i></b> | A Duke in Disguise is the tale of a radical bookseller, an illustrator who is extremely annoyed to discover he’s the heir to a dukedom, and a dirty book about Perkin Warbeck. It’s got “oops I’m in love with my best friend” feels and also “hey let’s eat the rich” feels. Also there’s a mean cat.<br /><b><i>A Duke in Disguise – Cat Sebastian</i></b> | Cat Sebastian returns to Regency London for the second instalment of her Regency Imposters series, A Duke in Disguise, in which an illustrator and a prickly publisher who have been close friends for a decade have to decide if friendship is really enough, or whether it’s worth risking what they have for the possibility of something more.<br /><b><i>A Duke in Disguise (Regency Imposters, #2) by Cat Sebastian</i></b> | Overall, A Duke in Disguise has a wonderfully strong cast filled with characters devoted to each other. If you’re looking for a romance with reluctant nobility, an examination of power dynamics, and lots of wine, cheese, and cranky cats, you’re in for a treat.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A Duke in Disguise - Cat Sebastian</a> </h3></p><hr/>
