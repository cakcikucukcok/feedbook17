        &lt;p&gt;Single mother Joanna Swan had already married one man with a Peter Pan complex, and one was her limit.

Because after all that she&#39;d been through, what kind of fool would she be to let herself fall in love with another man so determined to remain a boy?&lt;/p&gt;

And even though he&#39;d refused to let the past embitter him, it had left its share of scars–scars that perhaps one woman could help to erase. But only if he could prove to Joanna that, where the game of love was concerned, he was willing to risk all….&lt;/p&gt;
