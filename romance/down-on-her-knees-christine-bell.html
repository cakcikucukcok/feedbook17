  <title>Down on Her Knees - Christine Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Detective Rafe Davenport has always made Courtney DeLollis uneasy. While her instincts whisper, &lt;i&gt;Touch him&lt;/i&gt;, her mind says, &lt;i&gt;Run&lt;/i&gt;. But since she learned that he&#39;s dominant in the bedroom, she hasn&#39;t been able to forget about it. She should be appalled--she knows all too well what happens when a man has too much control--but a deeper, darker part of her is fascinated...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so is Rafe. The sexual tension between them is thick enough to touch, and damn, does he want to touch. So he suggests something that will benefit them both. Four scenes--because anything more is a relationship, and Rafe won&#39;t go there ever again. Each scenario is designed to tease and torment. To show Courtney that with every submission comes the reward of scintillating pleasure. But once he has Courtney down on her knees, Rafe realizes that she might be the one woman capable of bringing him to &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Dare Me series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Down for the Count&lt;br&gt;* Down and Dirty&lt;br&gt;* Down the Aisle&lt;br&gt;* Down on Her Knees&lt;/p&gt;" />
