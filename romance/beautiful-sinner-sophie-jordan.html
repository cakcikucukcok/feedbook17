  <title>Beautiful Sinner - Sophie Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locked in with the town bad boy . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most women would be scared, but Gabriella&amp;#8217;s only worried about resisting Cruz Walsh, who&amp;#8217;s even hotter than he was back in high school. Cruz was wrongly accused of the high-profile crime for which he was imprisoned; Gabriella&amp;#8217;s desperate for the scoop that will get her career off the ground and get her out of Sweet Hill, where everyone still remembers her as &amp;#8220;Flabby Gabby.&amp;#8221; Being stuck in a supply closet with Cruz is the perfect opportunity to land an interview. What Bri doesn&amp;#8217;t count on is Cruz taking &amp;#8220;up-close and personal&amp;#8221; to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#8217;s a silver lining to the hell Cruz went through, it&amp;#8217;s that losing his freedom put everything in perspective. Maybe starting over someplace new would be easier, but after years locked up, Cruz values his family&amp;#8212;and his true friends&amp;#8212;more than ever. So he&amp;#8217;s back home, facing the gossip, dodging reporters . . . and face-to-face with Gabriella Rossi. They&amp;#8217;ve both changed: Bri wants a story and Cruz just wants her. Another thing he&amp;#8217;s learned? Don&amp;#8217;t let a good thing slip away.&lt;/p&gt;" />
