  <title>Total D*ck - Celia Aaron, Christina Saunders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Kicked &lt;/i&gt;and the co-author of the &lt;i&gt;Cleat Chaser &lt;/i&gt;duology comes the third book in the &lt;i&gt;BAD BITCH&lt;/i&gt; trilogy by Celia Aaron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m your classic skirt chaser.  A womanizer.  A total d*ck.  My reputation is dirtier than a New Orleans street after a Mardi Gras parade.  I take unwinnable cases and win them.  Where people see defeat, I see a big fat paycheck.  And when most men see rejection, it&#39;s because the sexiest woman at the bar has already promised to go home with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Scarlett Carmichael is the one person I can&#39;t seem to conquer.  This too-cool former debutante has it all--class, attitude, and a body that begs to be worshiped.  I&#39;ve never worked with a person like her before--hell, I&#39;ve never played nice with anyone before in my life, and I&#39;m not about to start with her.  This woman wasn&#39;t meant to be played nicely with.  It&#39;s going to be dirty.  It&#39;s going to be hot.  She&#39;s about to spend a lot of time with the biggest d*ck in town.  And she&#39;s going to love every minute of it...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;*This is a standalone romance with an HEA.*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
