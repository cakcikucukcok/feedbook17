  <title>The Ruin of a Rogue - Miranda Neville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charm, wit, and nerves of steel have helped Marcus Lithgow gamble his way across the Continent. But when his heart is at stake, all bets are off for this most perfect rogue . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Brotherton is sick and tired of being an heiress. She cannot bring herself to marry a fortune hunter. Why can&amp;#39;t men like her for her sharp mind and kind heart rather than her impressive dowry? Just when she is about to bow to her fate as a confirmed spinster, she meets the handsome and charming Marcus Lithgow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been years since Marcus set foot in England&amp;#8212;why toy with the ton when he can fleece wealthy fools in Paris and Rome? Yet everything changes when he inherits a ramshackle estate. Marcus&amp;#39;s first and only chance at a respectable life needs funding . . . the kind Anne Brotherton can provide. Such a wallflower should be ripe for the picking. So why does Marcus feel like he&amp;#39;s the one hanging by a thread?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She nearly falls for Marcus&amp;#39;s smooth seduction. But when Anne realizes she&amp;#39;s being strung along, a lust for payback empowers her like never before. Two can play the game of deception. The game of love, however, has its own rules . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
