&lt;a name=&quot;_Hlk491933808&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for the Vistaria Has Fallen series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Am looking forward to seeing what happens in future installments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I look forward to reading more of this series in the future. I want to know what happens now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another brilliant series begins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cooper-Posey has packed in love, action, mystery, and intrigue, all in this novel. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to read the next installment!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other brilliant read from Tracy that captivates you from the very beginning as we look at the potential of a rebel uprising in a fictious Latin American country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Passion, action, horror, tragedy and adventure are all beautifully and masterfully woven by Tracy to provide maximum reading entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The characters are fantastic and the story line, well let&amp;#39;s just say it is very new and fresh. Lots of intrigue, excitement, mystery, and, of course, some romance as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Truthfully I cannot wait for the next book in the series to find out what is happening in Vistaria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
