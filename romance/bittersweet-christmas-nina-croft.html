  <title>Bittersweet Christmas - Nina Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Orphan Liam Ryan isn&#39;t asking for much this Christmas--just his Uncle John. And he&#39;s counting on Father Christmas to find a way to make that happen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Father Christmas tosses Liam&#39;s letter, claiming that the kid is asking the impossible, his daughter, Winter, takes over. Half-pixie, Winter, longs to do something important with her life, starting with getting a job at the Order of the Shadow Accords, the organization that polices the supernatural world. When she discovers Liam&#39;s uncle works for the Order, it seems like fate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savaged by werewolves and bitten by a vampire, no one knows what to expect of John Ryan, but it won&#39;t be anything good. So there&#39;s no way he&#39;s getting involved with his nephew...or anyone else. Worse, he&#39;s getting a babysitter over the holidays. But when he meets irrepressible Winter, all that matters is whether she likes her guys to be naughty or nice....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Order series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Bittersweet Blood&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Bittersweet Magic&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Bittersweet Darkness&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Bittersweet Christmas&lt;/p&gt;" />
