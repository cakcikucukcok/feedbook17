  <title>Cold Moon Rising - Cathy Clamp, C.T. Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TONY IS BACK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Mafia hit man Tony Giodone has been through a lot--he&#39;s turned into a werewolf, with a human mate and a pack leader tougher than his old Mob boss.  &lt;i&gt;And &lt;/i&gt;he&#39;s developed a powerful psychic ability--he can see into the past through other people&#39;s memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being mated with a human is difficult in more ways than one. Tony and Sue&#39;s relationship is full of struggle. Adding to Tony&#39;s trouble is a new problem with some old mobster &quot;friends&quot;...who also happen to be a cabal of Sazi mass murders trying to extinguish the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one man might be able to help Tony and the Sazi stop the cabal: Ahmad, the leader of the snakes.  He and Tony have a deeper psychic connection than Tony has with anyone else--even his mate!  Now Tony is along for the psychic ride of his life as the crown prince of an ancient empire is faced with his deadliest enemy: a woman he once loved, whom he was forced to betray . . . one who may now betray Ahmad, Tony, and all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
