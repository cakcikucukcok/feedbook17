      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A horse race &lt;i&gt;in trousers &lt;/i&gt;on Rotten Row. Visiting a gaming hall in a dress that would make her mother faint. Sneaking an invitation to a masquerade ball attended by only the wickedest, most debauched members of society... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of these things are scaring off bookish but strong-willed Amelia Bishop&#39;s stuffy, egotistical fiancé. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing left is to entice childhood friend Nicholas Wakefield into a truly engagement-ending scandal. The Wakefields are the height of propriety, and Nicholas&#39;s parents have made it clear a wife from the neighboring Bishop family would be unacceptable... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Nicholas would give up his family &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; his fortune if Amelia would ever see him as more than just a childhood friend. He&#39;ll go along with her scheme, even if it means ruining them both, because he&#39;s got a plan that will change her mind about him being merely the boy next door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book the Tale of Two Sisters series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The Importance of Being Scandalous&lt;br&gt;* A Scandal By Any Other Name&lt;/p&gt;" />
