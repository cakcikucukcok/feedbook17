  <title>Children of the Veil - Colleen Halverson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Tanner has one goal: to find her mother in whatever dimension she&#39;s imprisoned. But to do that, she has to face her estranged father, and to do that, she needs a shot of whiskey...or seven. But after an attempt on her life and the return of her lost love, she wakes up with one hell of a hangover and a whole barrage of questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finn O&#39;Connell doesn&#39;t know why the Fianna want him to aid Elizabeth in her search, but he&#39;ll take any excuse to be near her again. Together, they dive headlong into the shadows of her mother&#39;s secrets and find themselves embroiled in a Fae rebellion that will test Finn&#39;s loyalties and their love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Faerie realm verging on chaos, Elizabeth and Finn will embark on a quest that will lead them from the streets of Chicago to London&#39;s seedy Fae underground. But rescuing Elizabeth&#39;s mother means journeying to a place Finn can&#39;t follow, and Elizabeth is forced to make a choice between finding her at last or saving her own soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aisling Chronicles are best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Through The Veil&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Children of the Veil&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Echoes from the Veil&lt;/p&gt;" />
