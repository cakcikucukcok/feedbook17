  <title>The Trouble with Temptation - Shiloh Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love is the greatest risk of all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After seven days in a coma, Hannah Parker remembers nothing about the accident that landed her in the hospital--or how she ended up pregnant with Brannon&#39;s baby, the man she&#39;s loved since high school. Her body and heart have burned for him for years, and when she wakes up, he&#39;s sleeping by her bedside, anxious to keep her safe at all costs. But as Hannah struggles with her amnesia, a threat looms closer--one that could have deadly consequences if she recovers her memories.  She will have to trust Brannon completely if she is to keep what haunts her at bay...and their baby safe.... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Brannon McKay spent the last ten years fantasizing about Hannah. In his mind, he&#39;s explored every passionate scenario he can think of while, in real life, Brannon took their budding relationship and threw it away with both hands. Hannah doesn&#39;t remember what happened but now that she is awake, Brannon would rather die than watch her walk away again. When Hannah and his unborn child&#39;s lives are threatened, Brannon must stake claim to the woman who has held his heart captive for years...or risk disaster tearing them apart...&lt;/p&gt;" />
