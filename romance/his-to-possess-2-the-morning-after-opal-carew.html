  <title>His to Possess #2: The Morning After - Opal Carew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second sizzling segment in the erotic serial His to Possess, an intoxicating tale of a woman torn between a dominant billionaire and a tattooed, bad boy rock musician.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jessica and Dane shared a night of explosively hot, no-strings-attached sex, she never expected him to offer the one thing she needed most--a job at his business empire. &lt;br&gt;As she embraces her role as his assistant, it becomes impossible to keep things strictly professional. Her body burns for him, and his commanding presence awakens her darkest hungers. She&#39;s never been dominated before, and now she can&#39;t stop yearning to submit to him completely. &lt;br&gt;But carrying on a secret affair with the head of a powerful business empire puts her at risk of losing her job...and her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t miss the other installments of His to Possess: The Seduction (Part 1), Perfect Storm (Part 3), True Lies (Part 4), Entangled (Part 5), and Forever (Part 6).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
