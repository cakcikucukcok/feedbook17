Within weeks, the young couple married and moving back to the United States, and Colette must say goodbye to the only home she&amp;#39;s ever known. After traveling to New York and eventually to her new home in Berkeley, Colette discovers that she&amp;#39;s expecting, and life doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it could get any better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colette soon discovers, however, that Adam isn&amp;#39;t the man she thinks. Forced to endure an abusive husband and a lonely pregnancy, the only solace she can find is with her neighbor, John Wu. A devoted friend, John proves to be the shoulder she can cry on, and the man she can depend on to take care of her. But as time goes by and war draws nearer, life begins to take a dramatic turn. As the world begins to change around her, Colette&amp;#39;s fantastic story will take her around the world and back in defense of her family, her child, and her love. Packed to the brim with dramatic twists and turns, this exhilarating story follows one woman&amp;#39;s incredible journey through life, love, and war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colette is an exciting new romantic thriller by Michelina Vinter filled with fast-paced emotions and gripping suspense. Exploring the constraints of life and family, this captivating novel uses romance, action, and intrigue to draw readers in while showing them something more. An enthralling romantic thriller, the novel is a perfect read for anyone who enjoys leisurely reading. From action aficionados to romance junkies, this book is perfect for readers of all backgrounds and interests and will keep them hooked until the very last word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A delicious blend of action, adventure, and romance, Colette is a one-of-a-kind story that follows one woman&amp;#39;s fantastic journey through life. Encountering everything from first love and domestic abuse to the Gestapo and even a kidnapping plot, Colette&amp;#39;s life proves to be as exciting as it is dramatic and a truly remarkable story to experience.
