  <title>His Montana Homecoming (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (Big Sky Centennial, Book 6) - Jenna Mindel</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Snowbound with a millionaire&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Faith Shaw can&#39;t wait for another hometown Thanksgiving with the good people of Jasper Gulch. Turkey, mashed potatoes, apple pie–and this year&#39;s centennial celebration. Yet there&#39;s one person who isn&#39;t happy to be there: Dale Massey, the Shaw family&#39;s reluctant houseguest. When a winter storm strands the big-city millionaire in Montana, he is far from pleased. But the mayor&#39;s daughter suspects Dale&#39;s all-business attitude is masking a deeper hurt. Faith can&#39;t help but feel he was sent to Jasper Gulch for a reason. Can an old-fashioned girl and some holiday tradition help bring his weary heart home? &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BIG SKY CENTENNIAL: A small town rich in history…and love&lt;/p&gt;
