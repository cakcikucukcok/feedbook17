  <title>A Woman&#39;s Silent Screams - Mamie Harkless</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;A Woman&#39;s Silent Screams&lt;/I&gt; is the poignant tale of a woman struggling with the emotional strain of caring for her elderly mother who suffers from Alzheimer&#39;s disease, while dealing with the chaos of her own dysfunctional marriage.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Throughout her life, Mavis Maxwell has managed to suppress the screams of frustration that reverberate in her head, but lately everything is spinning out of control. Amid the turmoil of care giving, Mavis learns that she cannot always be there for her mother, a once-independent and courageous woman, now battling Alzheimer&#39;s disease. After her mother dies, Mavis reminisces about her childhood in an old white house with a tin roof in the deeply segregated South. In the meantime, her third marriage begins to fall apart. She starts to question her faith in God, the choices of politicians, and the heart-wrenching decisions she was forced to make while caring for her hundred-year-old mother.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;A Woman&#39;s Silent Screams&lt;/I&gt; takes an introspective look at the circle of life-marriage, friendship, and family-as well as the bonds shared by the strong women of this family.&lt;/P&gt;" />
