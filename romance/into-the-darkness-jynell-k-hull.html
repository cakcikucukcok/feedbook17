  <title>Into the Darkness - Jynell K. Hull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He walked the dark streets while his tortured thoughts turned over and over in his mind.
What had he been thinking? She had been almost eager to go with him and it had only been after they entered the empty park that her heart had begun to race and doubt started to seep into her mind. After she had seen the way he looked at her. She had sensed something was wrong and he had smelled her fear which only fueled his desire.
His need for her blood almost overwhelmed him. He could taste it sweet and heavy. He could feel it rushing over his tongue and through his veins. His arms trembled with the need to hold her against him, pin her to his body until her struggles ceased and she was limp and cold. Somehow through all of that he had resisted. But just barely.
The man that was still very much a part of him wanted to love her and be loved by her, to protect her but the monster, the blood thirsty, soulless being wanted her life. He had fought against it and won. This time.
He had left quickly, left her wondering what was wrong with him. He was wondering as well. What was he going to do? What could he do?
Leaving this town, leaving her seemed impossible to him. He didnt feel he could survive without seeing her, hearing her heartbeat in his ears but to stay meant he had to tell her what he was. It was only fair he just didnt know if he could. He pictured her clear blue eyes widening as she backed away from him. He could see the look of pure revulsion on her perfect face and hear her screams echoing through the night. 
It had begun to rain. Fat drops pounded against him as he continued to walk, continued to search for an answer. Three hours later and he was still undecided. His footsteps echoed in the stillness as he walked soaked to the bone." />
