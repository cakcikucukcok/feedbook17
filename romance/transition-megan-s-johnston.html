  <title>Transition - Megan S. Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Chimera are a race so old, the humans relegated them as a myth. The Gods
feared the Chimeras powers, believing they were a deadly race with physical
abilities beyond belief. So they split their race in half, condemning them to
wander the earth searching for their other half to be complete. Without their sodalis,
each is destined to live life without dreams, without love, without hope. The future
rests on fi nding their one true mate for life.
SHELBY ONEIL has led a solitary life with her parents. So when she goes to college,
she believes her life has just begun. Now in her second year, the dreams begin. She
dreams with the same man, night after night for months. When her dream world
becomes her reality, and her life becomes a danger zone, she quickly learns to trust the
one man who has thrown her into this new and dangerous world.
DEVELON COLE is Chimera and his race has been on earth as long as humans. His
people are desperate to fi nd their one true mate for life, and Develon has just found
his, in the small college town of Pullman, Washington. His duty is to protect her
against the Chimera hunters and guide her to who she was always meant to be, his
sodalis, his mate." />
