Now, as Aurore faces her own mortality, she needs to reveal those secrets that have haunted her for so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurore seeks out Phillip Benedict and asks him to tell her story. He&#39;s intrigued, but wonders why the matriarch of a prominent white family would choose to confess her sins to an outspoken black journalist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally Phillip agrees, but though he thinks he&#39;s ready for anything she might say, the truth is that nothing can prepare him for the impact of Aurore&#39;s shocking revelations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;" />
