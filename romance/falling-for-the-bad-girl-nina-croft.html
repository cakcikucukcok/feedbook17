      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a second generation detective, Nathan Carter is a cop, through and through, one who definitely sees things in black and white.

And he&#39;s been that way, ever since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Regan&#39;s favorite hobby was learning to crack safes, and she was very, very good at it. Still, she&#39;d always tried to keep to the straight and narrow, and only strayed when she believed a friend was in desperate straits. Now she&#39;s out of prison and starting over. If only she could forget that she&#39;d spent the last three years fantasizing about the stunningly gorgeous detective who locked her away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s inevitable that they meet up again--in bars, hotels...and hotel beds. Despite their differences, they can&#39;t keep their hands off each other. Still, it&#39;s just desire. If they give it enough time, it&#39;ll burn itself out. Because a good boy and a bad girl can&#39;t possibly make it work.
