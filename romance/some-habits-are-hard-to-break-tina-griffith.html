  <title>Some Habits, Are Hard to Break - Tina Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Up until her 13th birthday, she was a normal girl, with a normal life.  During the next 12 months, her father died and her mother threw her into a convent.  As scared as she was, she toughed it out until she turned 18.  Surprising even herself, she changed her mind about leaving, after having a talk with Mother Superior.  She ended up staying in that lifestyle, until she was 30 years old.  She had become Sister Delores, and was on a sabbatical from the convent, when she met a man named, Justice Thomas Weber.  Unbeknownst to the sheltered woman, Justice was a notorious criminal.  And because he had violated his current parole agreement, a search was on for his immediate arrest.  From the moment they met, Justice became completely fascinated by the girl, who was now going by her birth name - Lola Angelina Syndoni.  He was relentless in his constant pursuit of her, stopping at nothing short of murdering anyone who dared stand in his way.  They began seeing each other casually, but it didnt take long before Justice decided that he wanted more than just a mere friendship with her.   He gifted her with the book, with a large tie on the front cover.  He then begged her to read it, hoping that it would push their relationship into another direction.  Dating, love, and having sex was all new to Lola, but because she was now captivated by this moody man, who was now a part of her daily life, she faithfully did as she was told.  She found the storyline to be interesting, but not something she could ever do.  After much persuasion by her ruggedly handsome suitor, but with a ton of hesitation on her part, Lola finally complied and consented to giving up her virginity; however, it almost cost her her life.  Justice tried to follow the storyline in the erotic book, but because of Lolas many loud protests and his very short temper, things got out of hand and ended with him going back to jail.   Lola was able to escape after his last brutal and dominant sexual attack, and was rushed to the hospital where she now needs to heal.  Once she is released, does Lola go back to the confines of the convent where its safe and familiar?  Or does she stay in the outside world and take another chance at finding love?
