      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He might make her fall from grace...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebecca&#39;s life sucked before she became an angel. Crappy apartment, awful jobs, abusive boyfriends--it was no wonder she jumped at the chance to escape it all and become a real live angel. The problem is Rebecca&#39;s not very angelic, and she&#39;ll have to do more to earn her wings than end her love affair with the word f--er, frick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Especially when she&#39;s assigned to save single father Tony Weis, whose less-than-pure thoughts wreak hell on a telepathic angel&#39;s nerves. It&#39;s all Rebecca can do to keep her hands off him...but when she loses her memory injuring herself to save Tony&#39;s daughter, now it&#39;s Tony&#39;s turn to be her angel and care for her. But will Tony&#39;s devotion tempt her from her angelic path, even if it means being human again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
