  <title>Dirty Deeds - Megan Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alex Dawn is saying no to men. No to bad relationships, disappointments, and smooth-talkers. Focusing on her family and her job at Payton and Sons Automotive keeps her mind occupied and her heart content. She doesn&amp;#8217;t really miss a man&amp;#8217;s touch, until one night, one&amp;#160;shows up with the body of a god and a voice from her dirtiest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.M. Spencer is only in Tory, Maryland, to scope out the town as a possible site for one of his company&amp;#39;s hotels. The British businessman didn&amp;#8217;t expect his car to break down or to find the hottest little American he&amp;#8217;s ever seen holding a tire iron, piercing him with bright blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They agree to one hot night, one dirty deed to burn out the chemistry between them. But from their first kiss, Alex can&amp;#8217;t stop saying yes to this man. And when Spencer&amp;#8217;s company threatens everything she cares about, they must make the choice to stand together or apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Avon Romance&lt;/p&gt;" />
