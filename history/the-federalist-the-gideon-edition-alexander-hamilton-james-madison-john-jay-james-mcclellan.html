      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Federalist&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, constitutes a text central to the American political tradition. Published in newspapers in 1787 and 1788 to explain and promote ratification of the proposed Constitution for the United States, which up to then were bound by the Articles of Confederation, &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Federalist&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; remains today of singular importance to students of liberty around the world.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The new Liberty Fund edition presents the text of the Gideon edition of &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Federalist&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;, published in 1818, which includes the preface to the text by Jacob Gideon as well as the responses and corrections prepared by Madison to the McLean edition of 1810.

House of Representatives from 1789 to 1797, where he was a sponsor of the Bill of Rights and an opponent of Hamilton&amp;#8217;s financial measures.
