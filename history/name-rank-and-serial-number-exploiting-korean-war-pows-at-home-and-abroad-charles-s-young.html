  <title>Name, Rank, and Serial Number: Exploiting Korean War POWs at Home and Abroad - Charles S. Young</title>

In the Korean War American prisoners were used in propaganda twice, first during the conflict, then at home. While in Chinese custody in North Korea, they were pressured to praise their treatment and criticize the war.
