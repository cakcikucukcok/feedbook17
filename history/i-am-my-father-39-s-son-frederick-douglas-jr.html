  <title>I Am My Father&#39;s Son - Frederick Douglas Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story based on the collection of information from U.S. Army documents, my father, Sgt. Frederick Douglas Sr., Captain James Gill (Referred to as my uncle), and 6 other soldiers that were involved in the unauthorized mission to recover me from a Japanese black market baby ring. Army documents that my father had were also used to put together approximate timelines and fill in gaps of what might have happened during certain times where my father or uncle couldnt quite remember clearly. Some of the conversations in this story are assumptions of what might have been spoken as well as recollections from my father, uncle and a couple of men that were involved in my rescue. My father served 22 years in the U. S. Army with tours of duty in what are now Okinawa, Japan, Korea, and Viet Nam. My uncle served 20 years in the U.S. Air Force and as fate would have it, he was stationed with my father in Okinawa at Naha and Kadena Air Base between the years of 1962-1967. My father had just completed a tour of duty in Korea (3/1961-1/1962) and was being furloughed to Okinawa for a couple of months off until his next tour.  It was during January of 1962 when my uncle had just arrived from the United States and was assigned between Naha Air Base and Kadena Air Force Base in charge of air tactical recon and surveillance. Actual names are used in this story for the exception of the Colonel, which I changed his name due to my fathers oath of keeping him protected. What you are about to read is a fathers struggle and perseverance to find his son at all cost and risk, which was a mini-war in itself." />
