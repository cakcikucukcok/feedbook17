  <title>India the Land of Gods - Subhash C Biswas  D. Sc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="India is a timeless land of dynamic change and huge diversity. The social and political evolution over the centuries has greatly enriched the Indian culture and has given rise to great traditions and heritage. Its glorious history tells the tales of its prosperity despite destruction due to invasion by outside forces. This prosperity shines all over India especially, in palaces, temples and in many other monuments. More spectacular are the ruins of ancient India, which are still surviving to eagerly tell their stories to the patient listeners. 
The beauty of the sculptures and temple architecture of India are unparalleled; so are its natural beauty and its wild life. This book presents the travel experience of a couple that visits India to rediscover and explore the glorious vistas of the bygone era. They attempt to unravel the marvels of ancient India by digging inio the history, mythology and legends of every place they visit. 
This book is essentially a collection of travel stories presented in the fashion of a fiction, but with authentic facts and figures. Starting from the capital New Delhi and the exotic Himalayan towns of Haridwar and Hrishikesh, the travel continues to the colourful state of Orissa and then to the historical wonders and the magnificent sites of Karnataka and finally to the fascinating state of Tamil Nadu that gleams with vibrant spirituality around its countless temples. The reader will roam freely in the ruins, in the palaces and among the gorgeous temples with towering gopurams. The classic account of these travels allows the reader to stand up in a place where the present meets the past bridging time and space and surmounting all barriers, and to behold the most impressive evidence of the creative ability of the human mind." />
