  <title>North Korea Confidential: Private Markets, Fashion Trends, Prison Camps, Dissenters and Defectors - Daniel Tudor, James Pearson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;**Named one of the best books of 2015 by &lt;I&gt;The Economist&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;**&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;North Korea is one of the most controlled and isolated societies on earth, but what is it actually like to live there? How do you make money in a failed economy? How do you have fun under a violent, repressive dictatorship, and how does the secretive and infamous prison camp system work? Read this book to find out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;North Korea Confidential explains how the devastating famine of the 1990s became a catalyst for a network of black markets which have created a new generation of North Korean capitalists. From skinny jeans, to home-made booze, where there&amp;#8217;s a market for it, today&#39;s North Koreans can probably buy it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In seven fascinating chapters the authors explore modern North Korea today for the ordinary &quot;man and woman on the street.&quot; They interview experts and tap a broad variety of sources to bring a startling new insider&#39;s view of North Korean society&amp;#151;from members of Pyongyang&#39;s ruling families to defectors from different periods and regions, to diplomats and NGOs, to cross-border traders from neighboring China. The resulting stories reveal the horror as well as the innovation and humor which abound in this fascinating country.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
