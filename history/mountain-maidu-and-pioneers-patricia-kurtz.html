  <title>Mountain Maidu and Pioneers - Patricia Kurtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;BEGINNING WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION of Indian Valley, Pat continues with descriptions of Mountain Maidu life upon the arrival of white men searching for gold in the northeastern Sierra. Initially relations remain peaceful between the Indians and whites, but eventually conflicts arise as tribal lands were taken from the Indians. Later, some whites with government entities made unsuccessful attempts to civilize the natives. Additional demands were made upon the Indian to abandon his traditions and language. Some did embrace the new life style, but many continued to practice cultural traditions while being slowly drawn into a foreign way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Masters Thesis written by Patricia Lindgren Kurtz in 1963 was termed excellent by Dr. Katherine Dresden, Professor of Education at Chico State College. Dr. Clarence F. McIntosh, Professor of History and former president of the conference of California Historical Societies said, Mrs. Kurtz has compiled the most valuable information ever collected about the Indians of her locale.&lt;/p&gt;" />
