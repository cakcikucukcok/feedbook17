  <title>Shakespeare Was Irish!: &quot;Did You Ever Hear the Like?...Did You Ever Dream of Such a Thing?&quot; (Pericles) - Brian Nugent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As more and more scholars come to realise that the accepted story of William Shakespeare is untenable, this book tries to unmask the covert Irish influence on his work and the remarkable career of William Nugent, the only Irish candidate ever put forward for Shakespeare. It includes the full text of many original documents on Irish history, from the Reformation to the 1641 Rebellion. &quot;That in these lines I could as well express, As in my soul I do admire her beauty, Or that great Daniel, fit for such a task, This wonder of our Isle, had seen, and heeded, Then should his glorious muse, her worth unmask, And he himself, himself should have exceeded; Then England, France, Spain, Greece and Italy, And all that th&#39;Ocean from our shores divideth, Would over-run their bounds, and hither fly, To find the treasure, that our Ireland hideth, But best is, that we never do disclose it, Since known but of ourselves, we shall not lose it.&quot;  - RIchard Nugent &quot;Cynthia&quot; (London, 1604)" />
