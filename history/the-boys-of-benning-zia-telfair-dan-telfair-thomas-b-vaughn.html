  <title>The Boys of Benning - Zia Telfair, Dan Telfair, Thomas B. Vaughn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Boys of Benning highlights the lives of fourteen graduates of a 1962 Infantry Officer Candidate School class-before, during, and way after OCS. 
These men came from all across America to compete for officership in the United States Army. They emerged victorious from the crucible of OCS, and went on to serve our nation-in and out of the Army. 
Twelve of these fourteen men served combat tours in Vietnam. Most were wounded in action there; some more than once. They were point men in the so-called Cold War. For them, it was often hot war. 
Beyond the battlefields of Vietnam and the long wars divisive impact on American unity, these Boys of Benning persevered in their patriotic duty. They rose to the challenges and opportunities of higher rank and responsibility with confidence born from competence. 
Whether they remained in uniform-as most did-or left the Army to pursue civilian careers, the men whose stories leap from the pages of The Boys of Benning exemplify the time-honored traditions of Duty-Honor-Country. Despite their diverse backgrounds and subsequent achievements, they share a common bond, forged at Fort Benning and strengthened by their long service to our nation and their respective communities, where they continue to serve with distinction. 
The Boys of Benning is a treasure trove of exemplary leadership that far transcends the military milieu with valuable lessons for all who aspire to pursue excellence in their personal and professional lives. 
Advance Praise for 
The Boys of Benning 
The Boys of Benning is an American story. It captures the experiences of a diversity of Americans who were brought together more than half a century ago by a shared ambition to become commissioned officers in the United States Army. Its pages unveil the greatness of the Vietnam generation. Stories are told with remarkable candor. A deep sense of adventure, dedication to country and duty, bravery in battle, and a contagious sense of humor are found in this book. 
It was an honor for me to be in the midst of these men more than 50 years ago and their stories fill me with pride. I strongly recommend this book.
