  <title>An Agrarian Republic - Adam Wesley Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The familiar story of the Civil War tells of a predominately agricultural South pitted against a rapidly industrializing North. However, Adam Wesley Dean argues that the Republican Party&#39;s political ideology was fundamentally agrarian. Believing that small farms owned by families for generations led to a model society, Republicans supported a northern agricultural ideal in opposition to southern plantation agriculture, which destroyed the land&#39;s productivity, required constant western expansion, and produced an elite landed gentry hostile to the Union. Dean shows how agrarian republicanism shaped the debate over slavery&#39;s expansion, spurred the creation of the Department of Agriculture and the passage of the Homestead Act, and laid the foundation for the development of the earliest nature parks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spanning the long nineteenth century, Dean&#39;s study analyzes the changing debate over land development as it transitioned from focusing on the creation of a virtuous and orderly citizenry to being seen primarily as a &quot;civilizing&quot; mission. By showing Republicans as men and women with backgrounds in small farming, Dean unveils new connections between seemingly separate historical events, linking this era&#39;s views of natural and manmade environments with interpretations of slavery and land policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
