  <title>Rise of an Empire: How One Man United Greece to Defeat Xerxes&#39;s Persians - Stephen Dando-Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The true story behind the events in &lt;i&gt;300: Rise of an Empire&lt;/i&gt;, the sequel to Zack Snyder&#39;s &lt;i&gt;300&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action-filled movie &lt;i&gt;300&lt;/i&gt; focused on Ancient Greece&#39;s epic battle of Thermopylae, in which King Leonidas led 300 Spartans into battle against Xerxes and his million-strong Persian forces. In the sequel, &lt;i&gt;300: Rise of an Empire&lt;/i&gt;, the action moves to the sea, covering ten years starting with the Battle of Marathon and ending with naval engagement the Battle of Artemisium, which occurred the same day as Thermopylae.&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rise of an Empire&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of the real men and events depicted in the movie, focusing on the Athenian general Themistocles, one of the world&#39;s greatest warriors. He became warlord of Greece, built their navy and, by uniting Greece to defeat Xerxes&#39; fleet, enabled what we call western civilization.  Packed with vivid detail, clashes of arms and ships, blood and glory, &lt;i&gt;Rise of an Empire&lt;/i&gt; tells a  story even bigger than the big screen could contain.  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both an essential read for fans of the &lt;i&gt;300&lt;/i&gt; movies and the Frank Miller graphic novels they&#39;re based on &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An insightful exploration of the leaders who feature in the film, their backgrounds, motivations, command decisions, struggles, victories and defeats, from the Battle of Marathon through the Battles of Artemisium and Salamis: Xerxes, the Persian king determined to succeed where his father failed, and Themistocles, overcoming monumental hurdles to turn Athens into Ancient Greece&#39;s greatest sea power and leading city-state of the age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gripping narrative of the real-life naval battles of the first and second Persian invasions of Greece, with fascinating detail about the ships, the warriors and the tactics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
