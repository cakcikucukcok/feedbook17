  <title>Execution - Geoffrey Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his own darkly humorous style, Geoffrey Abbott describes the instruments used and their effectiveness and reveals the macabre origins of familiar phrases such as &quot;gone west&quot; or &quot;drawn a blank,&quot; as well as the jargon of the underworld. He covers everything from the preparation of the victim to the disposal of the body. &lt;i&gt;Execution&lt;/i&gt; is everything you ever wanted to know about the ultimate penalty---and a lot you never thought to ask.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It includes such hair-raising categories as: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·         Cave of Roses: A rare Swedish method of execution in which the victim was confined to a cave full of snakes and poisonous reptiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·         Bastinado: Involved the victim being caned gently and rhythmically with a lightweight stick on the soles of the feet until the mental collapse and eventual death of the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·         Sewn in an Animal&#39;s Belly: A living person is sewn into the belly of an animal and left to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·         The Spanish Donkey: This method of torture consisted of seating a victim on top of a wall that resembled an inverted &quot;v&quot; with weights attached to the ankles, the weights slowly increased until the victim&#39;s body split in two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·         Iron Chair: The victim is tied to an iron armchair and pushed nearer and nearer to a blazing fire.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·         Sawn in Half: Victims are secured in a standing position, pinned between two wide boards fixed between a stake driven deep into the ground while two executioners (one on each side) would wield a long, two-handled saw downwards through the boards.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Execution&lt;/i&gt; is a unique fascinating look at the grim and gritty history of sanctioned death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
