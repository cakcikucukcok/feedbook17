  <title>Secrets of the Japanese Art of Warfare: From the School of Certain Victory - Thomas Cleary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;This samurai strategy books is the first widely available English translation of Yamamoto Kansuke&#39;s classic treatise on strategy and tactics.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Secrets of the Japanese Art of Warfare&lt;/I&gt; is Thomas Cleary&#39;s translation of the seminal writings attributed to Yamamoto Kansuke on Japanese martial arts and military service.  A mysterious man of humble origins, Yamamoto distinguished himself in the service of the redoubtable Takeda Shingen.  Yamamoto was a career solider and founder of the so-called &quot;school of certain victory,&quot; from which the famous Miyamoto Musashi (&lt;I&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/I&gt;) emerged.  His school developed the art of discerning situational combat advantage, so that a warrior was able to commit to action only when success was virtually assured.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Translated and accompanied with helpful insights by Thomas Cleary, one of the foremost translators of the martial wisdom of Asia, this book is for all persons engaged in military, law enforcement, or emergency response, as well as for martial artists, athletes, business executives, diplomats and politicians.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
