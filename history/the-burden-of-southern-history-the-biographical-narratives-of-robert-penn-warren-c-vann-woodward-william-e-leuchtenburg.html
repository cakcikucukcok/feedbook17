  <title>The Burden of Southern History: The Biographical Narratives of Robert Penn Warren - C. Vann Woodward, William E. Leuchtenburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;C. Vann Woodward&#39;s The Burden of Southern History remains one of the essential history texts of our time. In it Woodward brilliantly addresses the interrelated themes of southern identity, southern distinctiveness, and the strains of irony that characterize much of the South&#39;s historical experience. First published in 1960, the book quickly became a touchstone for generations of students. This updated third edition contains a chapter, &quot;Look Away, Look Away,&quot; in which Woodward finds a plethora of additional ironies in the South&#39;s experience. It also includes previously uncollected appreciations of Robert Penn Warren, to whom the book was originally dedicated, and William Faulkner. This edition also features a new foreword by historian William E. Leuchtenburg in which he recounts the events that led up to Woodward&#39;s writing The Burden of Southern History, and reflects on the book&#39;s -- and Woodward&#39;s -- place in the study of southern history. The Burden of Southern History is quintessential Woodward -- wise, witty, ruminative, daring, and as alive in the twenty-first century as when it was written.&lt;/p&gt;" />
