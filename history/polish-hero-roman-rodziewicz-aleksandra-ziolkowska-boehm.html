  <title>Polish Hero Roman Rodziewicz - Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Polish Hero Roman Rodziewicz: Fate of a Hubal Soldier in Auschwitz, Buchenwald, and Postwar England&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm traces the remarkable and tragic tale of Roman Rodziewicz, a true Polish hero of the Second World War. Roman&amp;rsquo;s childhood was spent in Manchuria where his father, first deported to Siberia, later worked as an engineer for a Chinese company. Following the loss of his parents early in life after returning to free Poland, Roman was trained to manage a self-sufficient estate farming and producing various livestock, vegetables, and honey. Prior to the German invasion of Poland, Roman attended military school at the Suwalki Cavalry Brigade. After the surrender of the Polish army, the partisan forces of Major Hubal continued to fight the Germans. The brave anti-German activities of the Hubal partisans beckoned Roman and he joined them. About eight months later Major Hubal was killed. Roman escaped and joined the underground as an officer fighting the German occupation forces. Captured and tortured, Roman was subsequently imprisoned in Auschwitz and later Buchenwald. After the American army rescued Roman, he joined the Polish army in Italy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of World War II Roman settled in England. One of the greatest misfortunes of his life was losing contact with his fianc&amp;eacute; Halinka, and later learning she had married believing him to be dead. Two weeks after her marriage, she received a letter from Roman that he had survived the war. They met many years later, and Aleksandra Ziolkowska-Boehm witnessed the meeting of Halinka and Roman in Warsaw. Roman continues to live in England now having reached the age of 100 years in January 2013. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Polish Hero Roman Rodziewicz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; explores the incredible story of one Polish soldier of World War II, and provides an illuminating contribution to the historical record of the period. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
