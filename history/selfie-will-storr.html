  <title>Selfie - Will Storr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;We are living in an age of heightened individualism. Success is a personal responsibility. Our culture tells us that to succeed is to be slim, rich, happy, extroverted, popular--flawless.  We have become self-obsessed.  And our expectation of perfection comes at a cost. Millions are suffering under the torture of this impossible fantasy. The pressure to conform to this ideal has changed who we are.It was not always like this. To explain how we got here, award-winning journalist Will Storr leads us on a &quot;terrific tour through the history of self-obsession+? (NPR,Â On Point) that explores the origins of this notion of the perfect self that torments so many of us: Where does this ideal come from? Why is it so powerful? Is there any way to break its spell?Full of thrilling and unexpected connections among history, psychology, economics, neuroscience, and more, Selfie is an unforgettable book that makes sense of who we have become. Ranging from Ancient Greece, through the Christian Middle Ages, to the self-esteem evangelists of 1980s California, the rise of the &quot;selfie+? generation, and the era of hyper-individualism in which we live now, Selfie tells the epic tale of the person we all know so intimately--because it&#39;s us.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Selfie - Will Storr</i></b> | Early in Selfie, Will Storr observes that the rise of social media, with its attendant “social perfectionism” (whereby we regularly compare ourselves to others via their meticulously curated online profiles), appears to have made Westerners increasingly dissatisfied with themselves. We live in an age of “heightened individualism”, Storr says, one in which success—being slim, rich, happy, extroverted, and popular—is a personal responsibility.<br /><b><i>Selfie: How We Became So Self-Obsessed and What It's Doing ...</i></b> | Selfie is a compelling and immersive investigation into the rise of the Western world's love of the self. Starting in Ancient Greece with Aristotle, Will Storr tracks the rise of our self regard and the equivalent fall of our belief in community and the common good.<br /><b><i>Selfie: How the West Became Self-Obsessed: Will Storr ...</i></b> | Selfie is an incredibly dense and information filled journey to a satisfying ending. Will Storr clearly did an immense amount of research for his latest book. Traveling through history he shows how various people and cultures have impacted the way we think and view ourselves. The journey has a lot of insight into the way we think.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Selfie - Will Storr</a> </h3></p><hr/>
