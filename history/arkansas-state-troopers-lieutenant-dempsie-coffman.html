  <title>Arkansas State Troopers - Lieutenant Dempsie Coffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ride with the Troopers of the Arkansas State Police as they raid illegal gambling operations and take down drug dealers. Experience the helplessness as officers watch a fellow Trooper being ambushed. Mourn with the families when they receive word that a loved one has been killed in the line of duty. Feel the pain when you hear the sound of a twenty one-gun salute and cry as taps are blown at the funeral of a fallen comrade. You may wonder why anyone would choose to enter a profession that poses the danger associated with wearing a badge. Its pretty simple. Just ask any police officer who has rescued someone from a burning vehicle, or found a lost child and safely returned him or her to their parents. Then youll understand! 
Lieutenant Coffman has also written an autobiography entitled &quot;Life&quot; (its all about the Family) and a book of poetry entitled &quot;Southern Charm&quot; I believe that you will enjoy reading all of his books." />
