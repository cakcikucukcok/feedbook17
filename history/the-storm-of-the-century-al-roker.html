  <title>The Storm of the Century - Al Roker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this gripping narrative history, Al Roker from NBC&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; and the Weather Channel vividly examines the deadliest natural disaster in American history&amp;#8212;a haunting and inspiring tale of tragedy, heroism, and resilience that is full of lessons for today&amp;#8217;s new age of extreme weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of September 8, 1900, two-hundred-mile-per-hour winds and fifteen-foot waves slammed into Galveston, the booming port city on Texas&amp;#8217;s Gulf Coast. By dawn the next day, the city that hours earlier had stood as a symbol of America&amp;#8217;s growth and expansion was now gone. Shattered, grief-stricken survivors emerged to witness a level of destruction never before seen: Eight thousand corpses littered the streets and were buried under the massive wreckage. Rushing water had lifted buildings from their foundations, smashing them into pieces, while wind gusts had upended steel girders and trestles, driving them through house walls and into sidewalks. No race or class was spared its wrath. In less than twenty-four hours, a single storm had destroyed a major American metropolis&amp;#8212;and awakened a nation to the terrifying power of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blending an unforgettable cast of characters, accessible weather science, and deep historical research into a sweeping and dramatic narrative, &lt;em&gt;The Storm of the Century &lt;/em&gt;brings this legendary hurricane and its aftermath into fresh focus. No other natural disaster has ever matched the havoc caused by the awesome mix of winds, rain, and flooding that devastated Galveston and shocked a young, optimistic nation on the cusp of modernity.
