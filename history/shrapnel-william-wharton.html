  <title>Shrapnel - William Wharton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author of such classic wartime novels as &lt;em&gt;Birdy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Midnight Clear&lt;/em&gt;, William Wharton was one of the most acclaimed writers of his generation. However, he was also a very private man&amp;#8212;he wrote under a pseudonym and rarely gave interviews&amp;#8212;so fans and critics could only speculate how much of his work was autobiographical and how much was fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for the first time, we are able to read the author&#39;s own account of his experiences during World War II&amp;#8212;events that went on to influence some of his greatest works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the tales that Wharton never wanted to tell his children. Together, they illuminate a deeply personal, transformative experience:&amp;#160;of learning to kill, to &quot;abandon my natural desire to live, survive, and to risk my life for reasons I often did not understand and sometimes did not accept.&quot; Moving and insightful, &lt;em&gt;Shrapnel&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful, timeless work&amp;#160;from an acclaimed American&amp;#160;master.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
