  <title>The Tangierman&#39;s Lament: and Other Tales of Virginia - Earl Swift</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Go where the story is--that&#39;s one tenet of journalism Earl Swift has had     little trouble living up to. In two decades of covering the commonwealth, Swift has hiked,     canoed--even spelunked--a singular path through Virginia. He has also stopped and listened. This     collection brings together some twenty Virginia tales wherein hardship is revealed as tragedy,     and humor appears as uncanny, illuminating strangeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The     Pulitzer-nominated title story takes us to the Chesapeake island of Tangier, home to a Methodist     enclave over two hundred years old, with an economy almost wholly dependent on the blue crab.     The gradual exodus of the island&#39;s young people and the dwindling crab hauls point to an     inevitable extinction that finds a dramatic metaphor in the erosion of the island itself, which     is literally disappearing beneath its inhabitants&#39; feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epic piece     of reporting, &quot;When the Rain Came&quot; revisits the August night in 1969 when Hurricane     Camille descended on Nelson and Rockbridge counties, bringing with it a deluge of nearly     Biblical proportions that killed 151 people. It was later characterized by the Department of the     Interior as &quot;one of the all-time meteorological anomalies in the United States.&quot; Swift     looks beyond the extraordinary numbers to find the individual stories, told to him by the people     who still remember the trembling floorboards and rain too heavy to see, or even breathe,     through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other stories include a nerve-wracking inside look at the Pentagon on     the morning of 9/11, the travails of a failed novelist turned folk-art demigod, an account of a     1929 Scott County tornado (deemed the deadliest in Virginia history), and a profile of Nelson     County swami Master Charles, who boasts a corps of meditative followers, a mountain retreat in     Nellysford, and an incomplete resume. Each piece reconfirms Virginia as a land uncommonly rich     in stories--and Earl Swift as one of its most perceptive and tireless chroniclers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
