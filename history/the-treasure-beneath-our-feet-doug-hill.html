  <title>The Treasure Beneath Our Feet - Doug Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS BOOK CONTAINS THE RESULTS OF
TWO INDEPENDENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES
CONDUCTED IN THE HEART OF GLASTONBURY
TOWN CENTRE AT 11 HIGH STREET,
NOW THE FOOTPRINT OF THE BUSY
DOUBLE AWARD-WINNING
GAUNTLET SHOPPING THOROUGHFARE.
The studies were commissioned by the
Developer and Landlord/owner Doug Hill
between 2005-2007. They were request ed as
a pre-condition for planning by Somerset
CountyCouncil as it was considered imperative
to document the history of the site,
the development of which offered a unique
opportunity prior to the commencement of
the building works.
This is a Grade 2 listed building positioned
in the centre of a conservation area in the
heart of Glastonbury (adjacent to the Tri -
bunal, a Grade 1 Listed building) and as such
is considered to be of great importance.
The land at 11 High Street was stripped, mapped and the artefacts
logged. The broad spectrum of finds were subsequently donated to
the Somerset Museum, Taunton.
