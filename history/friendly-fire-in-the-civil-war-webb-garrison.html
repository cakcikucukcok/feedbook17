  <title>Friendly Fire in the Civil War - Webb Garrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;More than 100 true stories of comrade killing comrade:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;defective ammunition&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;accidental shootings&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;blinding smoke&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;deliberate fire upon comrade&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;mistaken uniforms&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;inexperienced troops&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;unknown passwords&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;On May 2, 1863, Stonewall Jackson was on the verge of the greatest victory of his career. Shortly before 10 P.M. he rode through the woods near Chancellorsville, Virginia, to find where the Federals had established their line. As he returned, his own men, in the noise and confusion, opened fire, woulding Jackson several times. One of the Civil War&#39;s first heroes died eight days later.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Stonewall Jackson&#39;s death is but one example of Confederate killing Confederate or Yankee killing Yankee. No war was as intense and chaotic as the American Civil War. Author Webb Garrison has brought together Jackson&#39;s story and 150 other instances of friendly fire in this unique book that strips away the romanticism of the Civil War.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;[With] night setting in, it was difficult to distinguish friend from foe. Several of our own command were killed by our own friends.&quot; ?Ambrose Wright at Malvern Hill&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;I thought it better to kill a Union man or two than to lose the effect of my moral suasion.&quot; ?Union Officer Louis M. Goldsborough&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;Whilst in this position my regiment was shelled by our own artillery. The officer in command should be made to pay the penalty for this criminal conduct.&quot; ?Confederate Col. Edward Willis, speaking of a battle at Gettysburg&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;Seemingly not content with the speed that the enemy were slaughtering us, one of our own batteries commenced a heavy and destructive fire on us.&quot; ?Union Maj. Thomas S. Tate, speaking of Tupelo, Mississippi&lt;/P&gt;" />
