  <title>Last and Near-Last Words of the Famous, Infamous and Those In-Between - Joseph W. Lewis Jr. M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author has assembled a collection of 3,676 last words from a select group of individuals as they faced their approaching demise. This compilation illuminates a group of beings ranging from convicted criminals to the most holy. Some serenely committed their souls to a higher being while others railed against oncoming death. Many are famous, some are notorious, and others blur into a less well-defined subgroup. The majority of entries consist of final spoken words, but a few wills, epitaphs, diaries, and last letters are also included in this collection. A brief sketch of each person includes birth and death dates, country of origin, and a short biographical sketch. Farewells spoken after the turn of the twenty-first century ensure that this compilation has some of the most up-to-date material in this genre." />
