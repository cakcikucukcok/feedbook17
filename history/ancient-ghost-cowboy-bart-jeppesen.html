  <title>Ancient Ghost - Cowboy Bart Jeppesen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Introduction
I guess I got my start the day I found an unusual set of crosses carved into a cliff face many years ago. Then from that point on, I was on the hunt for more. I spent endless amounts of hours reading and researching. During these years I also photographed everything I found. I traveled to many states gathering and comparing these finds. Which in turn created quite a collection created from findings in the field. From this massive amount of information gathered from many places far and wide, I have been able to connect the common factors found within these sites. This is what makes my books very unique. I know that I can speed up the success rate of each person in the field.
Originally, I had written only one book on symbols and signs. It was more of my journal and notes. But as I began to put it altogether it occurred to me just how much information and thousands of photographs were involved, along with the massive amount of work it would consist of. So it was agreed that this book should be divided. In doing it this way, I am able to teach the reader in a progressive manner from book to book.
We all know someone somewhere who found something or was close to finding something.  We also know that the majority of what these people had learned went to graves with them. My intentions are to share and spread this knowledge that I have gathered to help others become successful.
Keeping in mind these are progressive books. So in the event that you are scratching your head-that is a good thing! Because as you progress along, you will suddenly turn on the light and truly understand the secrets needed to make it all so simple.
