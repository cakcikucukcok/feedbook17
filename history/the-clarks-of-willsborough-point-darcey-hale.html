  <title>The Clarks of Willsborough Point - Darcey Hale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author invites her reader to come with her on a journey into the past. It begins in the Connecticut Berkshires in 1801 and transports us north with George and Lydia who set forth to Willsborough, New York and, ultimately establish a family Clark legacy. The lure was an opportunity to better their lives financially and in every way. We experience the emotions they felt as they prepared to leave behind all that they had ever known and participate in their preparations for their long journey over terrain and under circumstances that were totally unknown to them. We too are on the wagon carrying Lydia and her four offspring over bumps along mere tracks and, sometimes a real road, while George rides alongside as the ultimate protector. We join them in their hastily prepared meals along the route and share their fears of nights so exposed. We step onto the sail ferry at Charlotte filled with trepidation as we stare at the vast expanse of water that lies before us and finally step gingerly onto the warm sand as they reach New York at last. We feel their fears when plunged into what they had termed &amp;ldquo;wilderness&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; Filled with excitement and a bit of trepidation we move toward Willsborough and, much to our delight and surprise, we are greeted warmly as we approach the doorway of our new home. We are certain that life will be good and that this &amp;ldquo;wilderness is not to be feared&amp;rdquo;. George takes us into the Iron Shop where we see he and his cohorts crafting huge anchors for the newly created ocean going vessels of the US Navy and then tells us how these get to their final destination. Through it all we become part of their lives and we develop our own reactions to who these early Clarks really are, reactions that can become immensely personal. In the end, we are drawn into the final drama of the series, filled with anguish and concern. What will happen next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
