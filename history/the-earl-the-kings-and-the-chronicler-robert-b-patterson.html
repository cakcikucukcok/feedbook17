  <title>The Earl, the Kings, and the Chronicler - Robert B. Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Earl, The Kings, And The Chronicler is the first full length biography of Robert (c.1088-1147), grandson of William the Conqueror and eldest son of King Henry I of England (1100-35), who could not succeed his father because he was a bastard.  Instead, as the earl of Gloucester, he helped change the course of English history by keeping alive the prospects for an Angevin succession through his leadership of its supporters against his father&#39;s successor,
King Stephen (1135-54) in the civil war known as the Anarchy.
Robert of Gloucester is one of the great figures of Anglo-Norman history (1066-1154).  He occupies important niches in the era&#39;s literature, from comprehensive political studies of Henry I&#39;s and Stephen&#39;s reigns and an array of specialized fields to the &#39;Brother Cadfael&#39; novels of Ellis Peters.  Gloucester was one of only three landed super-magnates of his day, a model post-Conquest great baron, Marcher lord, borough developer, and patron of the rising merchant class.  His trans-Channel barony
stretched from western Lower Normandy across England to south Wales.  Robert was both a product and a significant agent of the contemporary cultural revival known as the Renaissance of the Twelfth Century, being bi-lingual, well educated, and a significant literary patron.  In this last role he is
especially notable for commissioning the greatest English historian since Bede, William of Malmesbury, to produce a history of their times which justified the empress Matilda&#39;s claim to the English throne and Earl Robert&#39;s support of it." />
