For a time Russia went through a period called &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; when all things seemed possible and a spirit of democracy was in the air. The Soviet Union was breaking up and everyday citizens were imagining a new democratic future, though this restructuring soon led to a rampant period of new capitalism and crime, before the crackdown and new economic transformation under Putin.&lt;/P&gt;

She traveled there three times between 1987 and 1990. This book describes her journey there in 1988 as part of a citizen diplomacy group that offered an opportunity to make personal connections with people in all walks of life.
