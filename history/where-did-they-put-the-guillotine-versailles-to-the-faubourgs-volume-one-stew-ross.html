  <title>Where Did They Put the Guillotine?-Versailles to the Faubourgs: Volume One - Stew Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walk with us through the village of Versailles during the early days of the French Revolution. You will visit the exact sites where the Revolution was born during the summer of 1789 (e.g., the Tennis Court oath, the meeting site for the Estates-General, and the caf&amp;eacute; where members of the Breton Club forerunner of the Jacobin movement met each evening). You will see where the Revolutionaries lived, ate, worked, and played (e.g., Robespierre, P&amp;eacute;tion, and Mirabeau&amp;#39;s respective apartments). Versailles Palace is the focal point of your next walk: The Women&amp;#39;s March on Versailles (5, October 1789). You will see the sites, rooms, and staircases in the palace where more than 20,000 women attacked the queen and her bodyguards. The next day, the royal family was escorted back to Paris, never to see Versailles again. The last two walks take place in Paris. The royal family is now a prisoner in the Tuileries Palace. The Revolution begins to deteriorate with the September 1792 massacres. You will stop at the site of one of the most feared prisons in Paris: La Force. The site of the former Knights Templar headquarters, The Temple, is one of the last stops on Walk Three. It is the final prison for the royal family. Here, the king begins his journey on 21 January 1793 to the guillotine, Marie Antoinette is taken to the Conciergerie, their son, Louis XVII, is murdered in the tower, and their daughter is finally released in December 1795.&lt;/p&gt;" />
