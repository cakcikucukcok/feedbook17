  <title>Treasures of the Spanish Main - John Christopher Fine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Tms Rmn&quot;&gt;This is a story about the lust for gold and treasure,&quot; Fine writes. In the 1600s and 1700s, Spain dominated the oceans with its fleet of galleons. Coming to the New World, these ships filled their holds with gold and silver and treasures beyond imagining. The seaway between Spain and the New World was dubbed The Golden Highway. On their journeys back across the seas, many were wrecked on reefs or destroyed by hurricanes. The watery depths now hold their treasures. Today, treasure divers seek their fortunes by attempting--sometimes successfully, sometimes fatally--to retrieve these hordes of riches. In &lt;b&gt;Treasures of the Spanish Main&lt;/b&gt;, readers relive each voyage of long ago as well as witness the modern wreck diver&#39;s efforts to extract their secrets.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Tms Rmn&quot;&gt;Included are: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Tms Rmn&quot;&gt;The 1622 fleet * The &lt;i&gt;Concepcion&lt;/i&gt; * The &lt;i&gt;Maravillas&lt;/i&gt; * The Shipwreck off Jupiter Beach * The &lt;i&gt;San Jose&lt;/i&gt; * the 1715 Fleet * and the 1733 Fleet&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Tms Rmn&quot;&gt;The voyages of centuries ago come alive with Fine&#39;s excellent historical detail. Readers will experience the wild storms and the results of unfortunate choices made by long-ago sailors. The eccentric treasure hunters of today, along with those of the past, create a mosaic of suspense and drama on the high seas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Tms Rmn&quot;&gt;A must for everyone interested in pirates, treasure, sailing, history, or just plain fun. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
