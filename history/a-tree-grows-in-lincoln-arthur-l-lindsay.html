  <title>A Tree Grows in Lincoln - Arthur L. Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reverend Trago McWilliams was a contemporary of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who preached a powerful message of nonviolence mingled with the love of God for one another. In McWilliamss work in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, during some of the most turbulent years for race relations in our country, he had a similarly positive impact. He took to the pulpit and worked to develop a congregation that would reflect divine intentions of what the community should look like.&lt;p&gt;
Trago and Margaret McWilliams began their interracial congregation in 1940 in Lincoln, Nebraska. &lt;i&gt;A Tree Grows in Lincoln: A History of Christ Temple Mission Church&lt;/i&gt; explores their vision and celebrates the people who have continued their commitment to overcoming the racial barrier that divides Gods people on Sunday mornings. It recalls Trago McWilliamss personal history and considers the lives that were affected by his ministry.&lt;p&gt;
McWilliams preached about the love of Goda love that is alive and well in the hearts of leaders today. Revealing his extensive influence and contributions, this history demonstrates how one person can make a difference in the life of a community." />
