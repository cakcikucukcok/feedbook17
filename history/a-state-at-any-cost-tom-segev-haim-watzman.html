  <title>A State at Any Cost - Tom Segev, Haim Watzman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2019 National Jewish Book Award Finalist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[A] fascinating biography . . . a masterly portrait of a titanic yet unfulfilled man . . . this is a gripping study of power, and the loneliness of power.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the founder of Israel, David Ben-Gurion long ago secured his reputation as a leading figure of the twentieth century. Determined from an early age to create a Jewish state, he thereupon took control of the Zionist movement, declared Israel&#39;s independence, and navigated his country through wars, controversies and remarkable achievements. And yet Ben-Gurion remains an enigma--he could be driven and imperious, or quizzical and confounding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this definitive biography, Israel&#39;s leading journalist-historian Tom Segev uses large amounts of previously unreleased archival material to give an original, nuanced account, transcending the myths and legends that have accreted around the man. Segev&#39;s probing biography ranges from the villages of Poland to Manhattan libraries, London hotels, and the hills of Palestine, and shows us Ben-Gurion&#39;s relentless activity across six decades. Along the way, Segev reveals for the first time Ben-Gurion&#39;s secret negotiations with the British on the eve of Israel&#39;s independence, his willingness to countenance the forced transfer of Arab neighbors, his relative indifference to Jerusalem, and his occasional &quot;nutty moments&quot;--from UFO sightings to plans for Israel to acquire territory in South America. Segev also reveals that Ben-Gurion first heard about the Holocaust from a Palestinian Arab acquaintance, and explores his tempestuous private life, including the testimony of four former lovers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The result is a full and startling portrait of a man who sought a state &quot;at any cost&quot;--at times through risk-taking, violence, and unpredictability, and at other times through compromise, moderation, and reason. Segev&#39;s Ben-Gurion is neither a saint nor a villain but rather a historical actor who belongs in the company of Lenin or Churchill--a twentieth-century leader whose iron will and complex temperament left a complex and contentious legacy that we still reckon with today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
