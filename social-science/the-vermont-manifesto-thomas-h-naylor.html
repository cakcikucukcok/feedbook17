  <title>The Vermont Manifesto - Thomas H. Naylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Not unlike other states, Vermonts quality of life, political independence, and sustainability are threatened by Corporate America, the U.S. government, the war on terrorism, homeland security, American imperialism, and globalization. This is a call for Vermont to reclaim its soul  to return to its rightful status as an independent republic as it once was between 1777 and 1791. In so doing, Vermont can provide a kinder, gentler, more communitarian metaphor for a nation obsessed with money, power, size, speed, greed, and fear of terrorism.   Long live the Second Republic of Vermont.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Reviews&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Vermont Manifesto is a serious examination of our God given right of self governance and that rights implication for secession. Dr. Naylor has made a persuasive case of the identical response to todays train of abuses that lead the Founders to secede from King Georges tyranny.&lt;BR&gt;
--Walter E. Williams
John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics,
George Mason University&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In 1991 the Soviet Union was peacefully dissolved by the secession of 15 states.  It had become simply too large and centralized.  So has the American Union.  Thoughtful people from every side of the political spectrum are beginning to realize that the only check to the tyranny, insecurity, and spirit numbing mass culture that continued centralization would bring is to seriously consider breaking the American empire up into alternative unions and/or smaller polities.  Professor Naylor is part of this debate, and has made a compelling case that little Vermont would be better off out of the Union than in it.&lt;BR&gt;--Donald W. Livingston
Professor of Philosophy,
Emory University&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I must assure you of my pleasure in, and approval of, your views on the Second Vermont Republic.  The assertion by Vermonters of a sensible foreign policy is wonderfully to the good.  You have my agreement and my admiration.
&lt;P&gt;--John Kenneth Galbraith
Retired Harvard Economist&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the idea of the three American states ultimate independence, whether separately or in union, I see nothing fanciful, and nothing towards the realization of which the efforts of enlightened people might not be usefully directed.  It is, to my mind, neither fanciful nor unjustified for us to 
hold in mind at this time the whole problem of the future development of the relationship with the northern parts of this country and their immediate Canadian neighbors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;--George F. Kennan
Former Ambassador to Russia
and Professor Emeritus, Institute
for Advanced Studies, Princeton&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Thomas Naylor makes a powerful case for an independent Vermont.  I think folks may soon be ready to consider the kind of wise and humane radicalism he recommends.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;--Bill Kauffman
Author of Dispatches from
The Muckdog Gazette&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are very few radical thinkers.  Thomas Naylor is one of the most courageous of these.  Distinguished, deeply moral, genius wild man.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;--Carolyn Chute
Author of The Beans of Egypt, Maine, Merry Men and Snow Man&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tom Naylor makes a serious case for an independent Vermont, a Second Vermont Republic that could immediately enter the world of nations and thereby begin the peaceful, democratic, and indeed moral process of disuniting the United States.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;--Frank Bryan
University of Vermont Professor
and Author of Real Democracy&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From the standpoint of puppeteers and their subversive papiermch, the Vermont Second Republic sounds like a very good idea to fight the megalomania of the globalizers.&lt;/P&gt;
