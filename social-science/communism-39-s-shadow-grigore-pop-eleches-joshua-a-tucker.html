  <title>Communism&#39;s Shadow - Grigore Pop-Eleches, Joshua A. Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has long been assumed that the historical legacy of Soviet Communism would have an important effect on post-communist states. However, prior research has focused primarily on the institutional legacy of communism. &lt;i&gt;Communism&#39;s Shadow&lt;/i&gt; instead turns the focus to the individuals who inhabit post-communist countries, presenting a rigorous assessment of the legacy of communism on political attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-communist citizens hold political, economic, and social opinions that consistently differ from individuals in other countries. Grigore Pop-Eleches and Joshua Tucker introduce two distinct frameworks to explain these differences, the first of which focuses on the effects of &lt;i&gt;living in a post-communist country,&lt;/i&gt; and the second on &lt;i&gt;living through communism&lt;/i&gt;. Drawing on large-scale research encompassing post-communist states and other countries around the globe, the authors demonstrate that living through communism has a clear, consistent influence on why citizens in post-communist countries are, on average, less supportive of democracy and markets and more supportive of state-provided social welfare. The longer citizens have lived through communism, especially as adults, the greater their support for beliefs associated with communist ideology&amp;#8212;the one exception being opinions regarding gender equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thorough and nuanced examination of communist legacies&#39; lasting influence on public opinion, &lt;i&gt;Communism&#39;s Shadow &lt;/i&gt;highlights the ways in which political beliefs can outlast institutional regimes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
