  <title>Fleeced - Dick Morris, Eileen McGann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the facts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has released 425 terrorists from Guant&amp;#225;namo, at least 50 of whom have returned to the battlefield to fight our troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both say they&#39;re fiscally responsible.
