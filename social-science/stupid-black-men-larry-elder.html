  <title>Stupid Black Men - Larry Elder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is life unfair for black Americans?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is racial equality the answer to every question of public policy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are a huge group of citizens being kept down by &quot;the man&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radio host and bestselling author Larry Elder has made a career out of being a thorn-in-the-side of the conventional wisdom crowd. He deflates the pompous and points out the completely logical truths hidden behind the nutty rhetoric and out-of-control pandering of many of the politicians and so-called leaders of a variety of special interest groups. In &lt;i&gt;Stupid Black Men&lt;/i&gt;, he takes on the mind-set that always captures the most media attention--as well as masses of public money--in this country: those who rail against racism as the root of all problems, and who end up hurting precisely those they claim to be helping.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they are demagogues like Al Sharpton, established politicians like Hillary Clinton, or entertainers like Danny Glover, no one escapes Elder&#39;s cogent arguments and rapier wit.  His sometimes hilarious and always infuriating examples of wrong-headedness skewer not just politicians for their smugness and hypocrisy, but also actors, educators, religious leaders and the &quot;mainscream media&quot; for keeping the story in the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Elder has a positive message, too: though they are fewer--and generally not as loud-mouthed--there are leaders and role models today who want to sweep away race-based whining and urge everyone in America, to share in the hard work, smart thinking and optimism that make this country great.&lt;/p&gt;" />
