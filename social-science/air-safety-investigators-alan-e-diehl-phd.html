  <title>Air Safety Investigators - Alan E. Diehl, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    This fascinating story explains how aviation crashes are investigated, and what goes on behind the scenes to improve safety. It is also the untold saga of
    how one maverick scientist battled the bureaucracy to save lives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Federal officials hired him to prevent an anticipated bloodbath from airline deregulation. He soon introduced innovations, such as Crew Resource Management
    training, which dramatically reduced airline accidents. However, when he dared expose lies to Congress, officials used the sky marshals to harass him. They
    then ignored his other programs, which contributed to countless unnecessary deaths -- including JFK Junior&#39;s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Becoming a military safety guru, his important tasks included training Air Force One crews, and going undercover to discover why a mysterious Soviet
    airliner crash killed an African president.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    But he was fired for blowing the whistle on the Pentagon cover-up of the worst fratricide since Vietnam. Congress and other important organizations have
    often sought his advice on civil and military aviation problems.
