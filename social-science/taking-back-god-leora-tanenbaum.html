  <title>Taking Back God - Leora Tanenbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Taking Back God &lt;/i&gt;Leora Tanenbaum recounts the stories of women across the United States, starting with herself, who love their religion but hate their second-class status within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve witnessed the preferential treatment of men in America&#39;s houses of worship, you will not be surprised to learn that there is a surge of women in this country rising up and demanding religious equality. More and more, religious women--Christian, Muslim, and Jewish--are declaring that they expect to be treated as equals in the religious sphere. They want the same meaningful spiritual connections enjoyed by their brothers, fathers, husbands, and sons. They embrace the word of God but are critical of their faith&#39;s male-oriented theology and liturgy. They reject the conventional interpretations of religious traditions that give women a different--and, to their minds, lesser--status. Rather than abandoning their faith, they are taking it back and making it stronger, transforming religion while maintaining tradition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanenbaum relates the experiences of Catholics, evangelical and mainline Protestants, Muslims, and observant Jews. The conflict they face--honoring tradition while expanding it to synchronize with modern values--is ultimately one that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; people of faith grapple with today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
