  <title>Outrage, Inc. - Derek Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Derek Hunter&amp;#8212;one of the most entertaining political writers today&amp;#8212;comes an insightful, alarming look at how progressives have taken over academia, pop culture, and journalism in order to declare everything liberal great, and everything great, liberal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progressives love to attack conservatives as anti-science, wallowing in fake news, and culturally backwards. But who are the real denialists here? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three institutions in American life run by gatekeepers who have stopped letting in anyone who questions their liberal script: academia, journalism, and pop culture.&amp;#160;They use their cult-like groupthink consensus as &quot;proof&quot; that science, reporting, and entertainment will always back up the Democrats. They give their most political members awards, and then say the awards make their liberal beliefs true. Worse, they are using that consensus to pull the country even further to the left, by bullying and silencing dissent from even those they&#39;ve allowed in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few years ago, the media pretended they were honest brokers. Now a CNN segment is seven liberals versus a sacrificial lamb. MSNBC ate their sacrificial lamb. Well, Chris Matthews did. Tired of being forced to believe or else, Derek Hunter exposes the manufactured truths and unwritten commandments of the Establishment. With research and a biting, sarcastic wit, he explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The growing role of celebrities in the political world, and movies with a &quot;message&quot; that dominate awards season, but rarely the box office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The unquestioning reporting on &quot;studies&quot; that don&amp;#8217;t prove what they say they prove.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The hidden bias of &quot;fact-checking,&quot; when the media cherry picks which facts they check.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Celebrity scientists like Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson blending liberal activism with pretend expertise outside their fields.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clever, controversial, and convincing, Derek Hunter&#39;s book gets to the root of America&#39;s biggest cultural war lies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
