  <title>Voice of the Other: Understanding Marginal Identities - Vulli Dhanaraju</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book addresses the concept of marginalization in understanding various identities in Indian society. Marginalization is often described as a social process where people refer to the periphery or &#39;margins&#39; of the society. It is defined as processes, in which individuals or communities are socially excluded and denied access to participate in social and political processes which are basic to integrate with the society. In this context the term, &#39;marginality&#39; is used in this book in order to understand the depressed and socially excluded sections, estranged by others such as &#39;Brahmanism&#39; in mainstream society, exploitative nature of non tribals in northeast and patriarchy in mainstream Indian society. The book is divided into four thematic sections covering 17 papers by scholars, social science researchers and other experts on the theme. The four thematic themes are Caste and Marginality; Ethnic Identities and Marginality; Gender and Marginality; and Literature, Language and Marginality. Each section has covered main theme of the book. Thus, the readers will find this book dealing with the voice of the &#39;other&#39; in the study of marginal identities." />
