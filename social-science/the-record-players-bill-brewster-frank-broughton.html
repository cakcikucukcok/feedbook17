  <title>The Record Players - Bill Brewster, Frank Broughton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Acclaimed authors and music historians Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton have spent years traveling across the world to interview the revolutionary and outrageous DJs who shaped the last half-century of pop music. &lt;i&gt;The Record Players&lt;/i&gt; is the fun and revealing result&amp;#151;a collection of firsthand accounts from the obsessives, the playboys, and the eccentrics that dominated the music scene and contributed to the evolution of DJ culture.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It started when, instead of a live band, someone turned on the record player, and suddenly partygoers had more than one style of music to dance to. In the sixties, radio tastemakers brought their sound to the masses, sock hop by sock hop, while early trendsetters birthed the role of the club DJ at temples of hip like the Peppermint Lounge. By the seventies, DJs were dictating musical taste and changing the course of popular music; and in the eighties, young innovators wore out their cross-faders developing techniques that carried them over the line between record player and musician. With discographies, favorite songs, and amazing photos of all the DJs as young firebrands, &lt;i&gt;The Record Players&lt;/i&gt; offers an unparalleled music education: from records to synthesizers, from disco to techno, and from small groups of influential music lovers to arenas packed with thousands of dancing fans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A history told by the visionaries who experienced the movement, &lt;i&gt;The Record Players&lt;/i&gt; allows a rare glimpse into the sound, culture, and craft that developed into a worldwide industry.&lt;/div&gt;" />
