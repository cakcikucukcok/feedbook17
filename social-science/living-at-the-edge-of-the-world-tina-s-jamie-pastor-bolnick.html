  <title>Living at the Edge of the World - Tina S., Jamie Pastor Bolnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Tina S. meets April, a teenage runaway, she thinks she&#39;s found her best friend.  She leaves behind her dysfunctional family to join April in the tunnels of Grand Central Station amidst the homeless and drug addicted.  Soon she&#39;s bingeing on crack--just like April--and stealing, scamming and panhandling to support her habit and to survive on the streets.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her own words, she describes her descent into crack addiction, being raped in the tunnels, her several arrests and jail terms and her grief and guilt over the death of April, whom she&#39;d come to love.  Finally faced with the reality that she might not make it through one more day, Tina takes her first difficult steps towards a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of a homeless advocate and his wife, a gay uncle dying of AIDS, and the woman who was to become her co-author on this book, Tina turns her life around and makes her way back to the world of the living.&lt;/p&gt;" />
