  <title>What Every Father Should Know About His Daughter by the Time She Is 17 (Hopefully) - Dale S Johnson, Kevin C Whitlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;I recently found out something about my daughter that as a father I should have known. As the father I believed myself to be I should have found out. It&#39;s not important what I found out what is important is that I realized that as close as I felt I was to my daughter there were somethings I did not know. I discovered other fathers in my cohort felt the same way. I am not saying that fathers should snoop. Frankly, the answers to some of these questions simply come from having a conversation with our daughters. Conversation not inquisition! &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;As fathers we know that one day we are rocking her to sleep while watching Elmo on, the next moment she is trying to get us to watch Lifetime, or is it Oprah? It is our hope that as time passes and you both get older and wiser that missed time does not translate into missed opportunities, and that this book will ensure that your little princess never turns into a stranger, or you to her. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Perhaps she has already told you but you were not listening. I thank God for putting this book in my heart. I pray and hope that this book finds its way into other father&#39;s hands so that they will know&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
