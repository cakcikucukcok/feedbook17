  <title>Jihad and Dawah - Samina Yasmeen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book provides a detailed account of the emergence and metamorphoses of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and its political arm, Jamat ud Dawah, since the early 1990s. Linking the group&#39;s narratives to the process of Islamization in Pakistan and divergent views on the country&#39;s Islamic identity, it is the first systematic analysis of how the organization, globally reviled as the perpetrator of the 2008 Mumbai Bombings, has developed its conception of da&#39;wah (proselytizing) and jihad in response to regional and global developments.
Samina Yasmeen makes extensive use of Urdu materials (pamphlets, books, ephemera) by Markaz Da&#39;wah wal Irshad, the parent organization of LeT, to examine the &#39;insider&#39;s vision&#39; of the dominant threats to Pakistan and the Muslim ummah, as well as strategies for countering these threats. She argues that while adopting an oppositional narrative vis-à-vis India and the West, LeT has increasingly turned its attention to da&#39;wah narratives within Pakistan engaging with broader spectrums of society. Women have increasingly been assigned significant agency in this narrative, and JuD&#39;s activism in education and social welfare has helped it acquire social capital. This, in turn, prompts a re-imagining of the movement&#39;s relationship with the Pakistani military." />
