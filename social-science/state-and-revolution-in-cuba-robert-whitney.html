  <title>State and Revolution in Cuba - Robert Whitney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between 1920 and 1940, Cuba underwent a remarkable transition, moving from oligarchic rule to a nominal constitutional democracy. The events of this period are crucial to a full understanding of the nation&#39;s political evolution, yet they are often glossed over in accounts that focus more heavily on the revolution of 1959. With this book, Robert Whitney accords much-needed attention to a critical stage in Cuban history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closely examining the upheavals of the period, which included a social revolution in 1933 and a military coup led by Fulgencio Batista one year later, Whitney argues that the eventual rise of a more democratic form of government came about primarily because of the mass mobilization by the popular classes against oligarchic capitalism, which was based on historically elite status rather than on a modern sense of nation. Although from the 1920s to the 1940s politicians and political activists were bitterly divided over what &quot;popular&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; state power meant, this new generation of politicians shared the idea that a modern state should produce a new and democratic Cuba.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
