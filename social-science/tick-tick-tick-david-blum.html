  <title>Tick... Tick... Tick... - David Blum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An insider&#39;s view of the most successful show in the history of TV, 60 Minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most popular TV show in America isn&#39;t American Idol, and it&#39;s not Survivor. Month in, month out, the most&amp;#8211;watched program in America is 60 Minutes, drawing a staggering 25 million viewers in an average week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its entire 34&amp;#8211;year history, 60 Minutes was the brainchild (and personal fiefdom) of Don Hewitt, the take&amp;#8211;no&amp;#8211;prisoners visionary who hustled the show into being and kept it afloat with a mixture of chutzpah, tough talk, scheming, and journalistic savvy. But now that Hewitt is 80 and grudgingly considering retirement, the show&#39;s direction is increasingly up for grabs, and the transition will surely be marked by some serious fireworks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As author David Blum provides a fly&amp;#8211;on&amp;#8211;the&amp;#8211;wall perspective on the show&#39;s upheavals, he&#39;ll also trace its past; although the show has aired some 5,000 pieces and has made household names of Mike Wallace, Ed Bradley, Leslie Stahl, and Morley Safer, much of the backstage story&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;the passionate pursuit of stories, the behind&amp;#8211;the&amp;#8211;scenes wrangling, and the stars&#39; prima donnish behavior&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;has gone untold. With full access to the producers, stars, and executives, Blum will give readers an unprecedented view of the personalities and events that have shaped 60 Minutes &amp;#8211; and a new perspective on how current events become news.&lt;/p&gt;" />
