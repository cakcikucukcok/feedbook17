  <title>Fast Money Schemes - John Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In the late 1990s and early 2000s a wave of Ponzi schemes swept through Papua New Guinea, Australia, and the Solomon Islands. The most notorious scheme, U-Vistract, attracted many thousands of investors, enticing them with promises of 100 percent interest to be paid monthly. Its founder, Noah Musingku, was a charismatic leader who promoted the scheme as a form of Christian mission and as the basis for establishing an independent kingdom. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Fast Money Schemes&lt;/I&gt; uses in-depth interviews with investors, newspaper accounts, and participant observation to understand the scheme&#39;s appeal from the point of view of those who invested and lost, showing that organizers and investors alike understood the scheme as a way of accessing and participating in a global economy. John Cox delivers a &quot;post-village&quot; ethnography that gives insight into the lives of urban, middle-class Papua New Guineans, a group that is not familiar to US readers and that has seldom been a focus of anthropological interest. The book&#39;s concern with understanding the interweaving of morality, finance, and aspirations shared by a global cosmopolitan middle class has wide resonance beyond studies of Papua New Guinea and anthropology.&lt;/P&gt;" />
