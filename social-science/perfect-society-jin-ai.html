  <title>Perfect Society - Jin Ai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The perfect society depicted in this book is inspired by the perfect aquarium. The book describes the basic outline of a perfect society and explores the practical feasibility of realizing a perfect society. In the book, one can also find the answers to essential issues related to human society. For example, what is the nature of people? What is the truth? What is the model of the ultimate perfect society of mankind? Can humans establish a realistic perfect society? 
The book differs from existing political books, which generally overidealize their society models to the extent of being detached from reality or are limited by a class stand that narrows their outlook. Perfect Society, written from the viewpoint of the whole ecosystem, presents a unique perspective and analyzes various problems of human society based on all the cultural achievements of modern society. It will help people gain a deep understanding of the relations among all the elements of human society and is a must-read classic for those researching the quest for a perfect society. The book follows a careful thinking path and strict logic and is easy to master. 
Perfect Society is written in a scientific style, shaking off the common feature of former political books, which are either obscure and difficult to understand or lack scientific basis. Therefore, it can serve as a milestone for political writings relating to human nature." />
