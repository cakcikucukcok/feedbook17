  <title>Together We Rise - The Women&#39;s March Organizers, Condé Nast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In celebration of the one-year anniversary of Women&amp;#8217;s March, this gorgeously designed full-color book offers an unprecedented, front-row seat to one of the most galvanizing movements in American history, with exclusive interviews with Women&amp;#8217;s March organizers, never-before-seen photographs, and essays by feminist activists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 21, 2017, the day after Donald J. Trump&amp;#8217;s inauguration, more than three million marchers of all ages and walks of life took to the streets as part of the largest protest in American history. In red states and blue states, in small towns and major urban centers, from Boise to Boston, Bangkok to Buenos Aires, people from eighty-two countries&amp;#8212;on all seven continents&amp;#8212;rose up in solidarity to voice a common message: Hear our voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It became the largest global protest in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiled by Women&amp;#8217;s March organizers, in partnership with Cond&amp;#233; Nast and &lt;em&gt;Glamour&lt;/em&gt; magazine Editor in Chief Cindi Leive, Together We Rise&amp;#8212;published for the one-year anniversary of the event&amp;#8212;is the complete chronicle of this remarkable uprising. For the first time, Women&amp;#8217;s March organizers&amp;#8212;including Bob Bland, Cassady Fendlay, Sarah Sophie Flicker, Janaye Ingram, Tamika Mallory, Paola Mendoza, Carmen Perez, and Linda Sarsour &amp;#8212;tell their personal stories and reflect on their collective journey in an oral history written by Jamia Wilson, writer, activist and director of The Feminist Press. They provide an inside look at how the idea for the event originated, how it was organized, how it became a global movement that surpassed their wildest expectations, and how they are sustaining and building on the widespread outrage, passion, and determination that sparked it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together We Rise&lt;/em&gt; interweaves their stories with &quot;Voices from the March&quot;&amp;#8212;recollections from real women who were there, across the world&amp;#8212;plus exclusive images by top photographers, and 20 short, thought-provoking essays by esteemed writers, celebrities and artists including Rowan Blanchard, Senator Tammy Duckworth, America Ferrera, Roxane Gay, Ilana Glazer, Ashley Judd, Valarie Kaur, David Remnick, Yara Shahidi, Jill Soloway, Jia Tolentino, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, and Elaine Welteroth. An inspirational call to action that reminds us that together, ordinary people can make a difference, &lt;em&gt;Together We Rise&lt;/em&gt; is an unprecedented look at a day that made history&amp;#8212;and the beginning of a resistance movement to reclaim our future. &lt;/p&gt;" />
