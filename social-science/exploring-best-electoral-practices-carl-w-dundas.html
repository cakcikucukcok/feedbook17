  <title>Exploring Best Electoral Practices - Carl W. Dundas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The family of best electoral practices is growing in most democracies. It can be found in mature and new, as well as in emerging democracies, perhaps more common in the former than in the latter two categories. The goal of best electoral practices is to improve election administration and services to the electorate. 
Best electoral practices are showing steady upward growth in emerging democracies and the potential for continued growth is positive. Widespread international interest in democratic elections and improved international and national election observation harmonization procedures will continue to assist in improving election administration. 
The use of electoral technologies and the notional entry into the age of digital democracy will undoubtedly aid and enhance best electoral practices aspirations in many emerging democracies." />
