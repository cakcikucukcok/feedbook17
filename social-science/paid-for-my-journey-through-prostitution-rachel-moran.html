  <title>Paid For – My Journey through Prostitution - Rachel Moran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you are 15 years old and destitute, too unskilled to work and too young to claim unemployment benefit, your body is all you have left to sell.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘THE BEST WORK BY ANYONE ON PROSTUTION EVER.’ Catherine A. MacKinnon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel Moran came from a troubled family background. Taken into state care at 14, she became homeless and got involved in prostitution aged 15, ending up isolated, drug-addicted, outside of society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel’s experience was one of violence, loneliness, and relentless exploitation and abuse. Her story reveals the emotional cost of selling your body night after night in order to survive &amp;ndash; loss of innocence, loss of self-worth and loss of connection to mainstream society, which makes it all the more difficult to escape the world of prostitution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paid For&lt;/i&gt; reveals the raw reality behind prevailing myths about sex work: that working indoors is safer; that some forms of sex work are ‘classier’ than others; that selling sex can be empowering; that a ‘happy hooker’ exists. The biggest lie of all, Rachel says, is that women can choose to be in prostitution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the age of 22 she managed, with remarkable strength, to liberate herself from the cycle of drug abuse and prostitution. She went to university, gained a degree and forged a new life, but she always promised that one day she would complete this book. &lt;i&gt;Paid For&lt;/i&gt; is her story, in her own words and in her own name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;Striking, saturated with sad and angry detail and raw, effective analogy.&lt;/i&gt;’ The New York Times&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ‘&lt;i&gt;This is surely the best, most personal, profound, eye-opening book ever written about prostitution &amp;ndash; irrefutable proof of why it should NEVER be legalized.&lt;/i&gt;’ Jane Fonda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;Rachel Moran’s &lt;/i&gt;Paid For&lt;i&gt; should be required reading in courses on human rights, in police training and law schools, and in sex education courses that separate welcome sex from body invasion.&lt;/i&gt;’ Gloria Steinem&lt;/p&gt;" />
