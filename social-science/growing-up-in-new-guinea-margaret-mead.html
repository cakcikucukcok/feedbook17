  <title>Growing Up in New Guinea - Margaret Mead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following the sensational success of her first book, &lt;em&gt;Coming of Age in Samoa,&lt;/em&gt; Margaret Mead continued her brilliant work in &lt;em&gt;Growing Up in New Guinea,&lt;/em&gt; detailing her study of the Manus, a New Guinea people still untouched by the outside world when she visited them in 1928. She lived in their noisy fishing village at a pivotal time -- after warfare had vanished but before missions and global commerce had begun to change their lives. She developed fascinating insights into their family lives, exploring their attitudes toward sex, marriage, the rearing of children, and the supernatural, which led her to see intriguing parallels with modern Western society. Reissued for the centennial of her birth and featuring introductions by Howard Gardner and Mead&#39;s daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson, this book offers important anthropological insights into human societies and vividly captures a vanished way of life." />
