  <title>Why Marx Was Wrong - Lawrence Eubank</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The subject of this book is the &quot;negative assault on democratic capitalism&quot; embodied in Capital  A Critique of Political Economy, Marx&#39;s great work devoted to delineating the crimes and inequities of capitalist societies and market economies. 
The book is a systematic, step-by-step analysis of Marx&#39;s logic. It is a deconstruction of the arguments and deductions by which he reaches his main conclusion: that capitalism is corrupt in its essential nature, and that capitalists gain wealth not by any legitimate means, but by appropriating unpaid labor or &quot;surplus value&quot; from the working masses. Despite the disappearance of the Soviet bloc and the waning of Communist zealotry, that is still a widely-believed doctrine. 
Marx&#39;s accusation against capitalism, and the course of argumentation by which he arrives at it, together form the subject of the present volume." />
