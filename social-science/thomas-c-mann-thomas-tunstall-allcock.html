  <title>Thomas C. Mann - Thomas Tunstall Allcock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Lyndon Johnson was often blamed for abandoning Kennedy&#39;s vision of development and progress in Latin America in favor of his own domestic concerns: anti-communism and economic stability. Johnson, along with his fellow Texan and chief adviser on inter-American affairs Thomas C. Mann, nonetheless offered a vision for American engagement with the developing world even as congressional funding and public enthusiasm for such programs waned and Johnson&#39;s presidency collapsed under the weight of the Vietnam War.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book explores Lyndon Johnson&#39;s Latin American policy, from his key advisers to development programs and military interventions, to establish a new perspective on the impact of a complex and controversial president on a tumultuous period in the history of the Western Hemisphere. Demonstrating that much of the negative coverage of their efforts emerged from disgruntled Kennedy loyalists, Tunstall Allcock argues that Johnson and Mann were both New Dealers who possessed a keen desire to operate as good neighbors and support Latin American development and regional integration while dealing with domestic pressure from both right and left.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Based on extensive primary research in multiple archives, this much-needed book provides a crucial exploration of how inter-American relations transitioned from the enthusiasm and excitement of the Kennedy years to the neglect and frustration of the Nixon presidency.&lt;/P&gt;" />
