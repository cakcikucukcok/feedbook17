  <title>Servants of Globalization - Rhacel Parreñas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Servants of Globalization&lt;/I&gt; offers a groundbreaking study of migrant Filipino domestic workers who leave their own families behind to do the caretaking work of the global economy. Since its initial publication, the book has informed countless students and scholars and set the research agenda on labor migration and transnational families.
With this second edition, Rhacel Salazar Parreñas returns to Rome and Los Angeles to consider how the migrant communities have changed. Children have now joined their parents. Male domestic workers are present in significantly greater numbers. And, perhaps most troubling, the population has aged, presenting new challenges for the increasingly elderly domestic workers. New chapters discuss these three increasingly important constituencies. The entire book has been revised and updated, and a new introduction offers a global, comparative overview of the citizenship status of migrant domestic workers. &lt;I&gt;Servants of Globalization&lt;/I&gt; remains the defining work on the international division of reproductive labor." />
