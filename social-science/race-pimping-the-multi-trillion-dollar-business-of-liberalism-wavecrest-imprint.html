  <title>RACE PIMPING: The Multi-Trillion Dollar Business of Liberalism - Wavecrest Imprint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Race pimping has cost America TRILLIONS of dollars, as the money in race guilt is fantastic. Politicians line their pockets and those of family and friends, while  delivering little to nothing to their constituents or the community at large.          *********************************************************************   Don&#39;t know whether to buy this book or not, then you are a racist sellout!  Just kidding. But it does mean you are likely cheap, and not to go all  Shawshank on you, but salvation lies within!    To help you get over the hump, here are a few excerpts to ponder:   &quot;The money in diversity is enormous, even bigger than former sportscaster turned political pundit turned sportscaster Keith Olbermann&#39;s ego.&quot;   &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to be a &quot;reverend&quot; and father children out of wedlock without repercussions? If you study hard, this book will teach you how to have your non-profit organization pay your mistress and your child support - all at the same time.&quot;   &quot;You must be so black that if you eat sushi, watch reruns of Dawson&#39;s Creek and Friends, or enjoy the ballet, you will hang yourself.&quot;   &quot;Everything your constituency does or think must be viewed through the very narrow prism of blackness. They must talk black, walk black, think black, read black, eat black, drink black, dress black, smell black, sneeze black, cough black, yawn black, surf the Internet black, and even urinate black. Failure to do so has consequences.&quot;    *********************************************************************      Other books written by Kevin Jackson: • The BIG Black Lie: How I Learned The Truth About The Democrat Party • Sexy Brilliance: ...and other political lies!" />
