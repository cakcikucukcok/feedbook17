  <title>Citizenship and Place - Cherstin M. Lyon, Allison F. Goebel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book explores the ways in which individuals and groups negotiate the meaning and rights associated with their citizenship or lack thereof within the context of diverse interpretations of &amp;quot;place.&amp;quot; Place might be a specific location as in the place where a person is able to work, or live, or it may be more metaphorical, as in the spaces created to organize protest online. Place may even be defined by its absence or distance, as is the case with refugees and stateless individuals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chapters in the first half of the book examine citizenship and place within the city. The second half examines citizenship and place beyond the city, beyond the nation, and in the case of statelessness, even beyond citizenship. The volume ends with a chapter that asserts that all citizenship is local. Citizenship, when examined from the ground up within the context of place, can capture conflicts and negotiations around belonging and rights that include those who are refugees, those who are stateless, and those whose very presence and demand for rights defy normative or state-driven definitions of who has the right to claim rights based on citizenship. This book seeks to help the reader push traditional boundaries and critically examine notions of citizenship in these spaces. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
