  <title>One Nation Under Dog - Michael Schaffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A witty, insightful, and affectionate examination of how and why we spend billions on our pets, and what this tells us about ourselves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Michael Schaffer and his wife drove to a rural shelter and adopted an emaciated, dreadlocked Saint Bernard who they named Murphy. They vowed that they&#39;d never become the kind of people who send dogs named Baxter and Sonoma out to get facials, or shell out for $12,000 hip replacements. But then they started to get weird looks from the in-laws: You hired a trainer? Your vet prescribed antidepressants? So Schaffer started poking around and before long happened on an astonishing statistic: the pet industry, estimated at $43 billion this year, was just $17 billion barely a decade earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Nation Under Dog&lt;/i&gt; is about America&#39;s pet obsession--the explosion, over the past generation, of an industry full of pet masseuses, professional dog-walkers, organic kibble, leash-law militants, luxury pet spas, veterinary grief counselors, upscale dog shampoos, and the like: a booming economy that is evidence of tremendous and rapid change in the status of America&#39;s pets. Schaffer provides a surprising and lively portrait of our country--as how we treat our pets reflects evolving ideas about domesticity, consumerism, politics, and family--through this fabulously reported and sympathetic look at both us and our dogs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
