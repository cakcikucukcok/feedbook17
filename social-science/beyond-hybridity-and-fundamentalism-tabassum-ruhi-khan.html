  <title>Beyond Hybridity and Fundamentalism - Tabassum Ruhi Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The question of identity and especially its formation among youth, has received significant academic attention as our worlds become intricately and unpredictably connected through satellite televisions, mobile telephones, Internet and social networking platforms. Marking a distinct addition to such scholarship, this volume is an ethnographic study of the under-investigated issue of Indian Muslim youth&#39;s emergent subjectivity in a media-saturated globalized Indian society. The author develops the idea of &#39;convoluted modernity&#39; to explain Muslim youth&#39;s reactions to multifarious and divergent influences both from the East as well as the West shaping their everyday life. The concept illustrates how Muslim youths&#39; ideas about self and community draw equally on MTV as on Peace TV to create a complex truck between consumerist hedonism and globalized Islam. Introducing a new perspective to studies on globalization, media and cultural politics, this book shows how interpolation of local and global in the accelerated virtual spheres and their contextual interpretation within an expanding economy, notwithstanding Muslim youth&#39;s disadvantaged position, shape alternate modernities rife with ambiguities and beyond binaries of progress and regression." />

    	<p>The question of identity and especially its formation among youth, has received significant academic attention as our worlds become intricately and unpredictably connected through satellite televisions, mobile telephones, Internet and social networking platforms. Marking a distinct addition to such scholarship, this volume is an ethnographic study of the under-investigated issue of Indian Muslim youth's emergent subjectivity in a media-saturated globalized Indian society. The author develops the idea of 'convoluted modernity' to explain Muslim youth's reactions to multifarious and divergent influences both from the East as well as the West shaping their everyday life. The concept illustrates how Muslim youths' ideas about self and community draw equally on MTV as on Peace TV to create a complex truck between consumerist hedonism and globalized Islam.
