  <title>The Shape of Things to Come - Greil Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Mystery Train&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Lipstick Traces&lt;/i&gt;, an exhilarating and provocative investigation of the tangle of American identity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;America is a place and a story, made up of exuberance and suspicion, crime and liberation, lynch mobs and escapes; its greatest testaments are made of portents and warnings, biblical allusions that lose all certainty in the American air.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; It is this story of self-invention and nationhood that Greil Marcus rediscovers, beginning with John Winthrop&#39;s invocation of America as a &quot;city on the hill,&quot; Lincoln&#39;s second inaugural address, and Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s speech about his American dream. Listening to these prophetic founding statements, Marcus explores America&#39;s promise as a New Jerusalem and the nature of its covenant: first with God, and then with its own citizens. In the nineteenth century, this vision of the nation&#39;s story was told in public as part of common discourse, to be fought over in plain speech and flights of gorgeous rhetoric. Since then, Marcus argues, it has become cryptic, a story told more in art than in politics. He traces it across the continent and through time, hearing the tale in the disparate voices of writers, filmmakers, performers, and actors: Philip Roth, David Lynch, David Thomas, Allen Ginsberg, Sheryl Lee, and Bill Pullman. In &lt;i&gt;The Shape of Things to Come&lt;/i&gt;, the future and the past merge in extraordinary and uncanny ways, and Marcus proves once again that he is our most imaginative and original cultural critic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
