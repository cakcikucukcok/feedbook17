  <title>Everyone Loves a Good Train Wreck - Eric G. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why can&#39;t we look away?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether we admit it or not, we&#39;re fascinated by evil. Dark fantasies, morbid curiosities, Schadenfreude: As conventional wisdom has it, these are the symptoms of our wicked side, and we succumb to them at our own peril. But we&#39;re still compelled to look whenever we pass a grisly accident on the highway, and there&#39;s no slaking our thirst for gory entertainments like horror movies and police procedurals. What makes these spectacles so irresistible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Everyone Loves a Good Train Wreck&lt;/i&gt;, the scholar Eric G. Wilson sets out to discover the source of our attraction to the caustic, drawing on the findings of biologists, sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, philosophers, theologians, and artists. A professor of English literature and a lifelong student of the macabre, Wilson believes there&#39;s something nourishing in darkness. &quot;To repress death is to lose the feeling of life,&quot; he writes. &quot;A closeness to death discloses our most fertile energies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His examples are legion, and startling in their diversity. Citing everything from elephant graveyards and Susan Sontag&#39;s &lt;i&gt;On Photography&lt;/i&gt; to the Tiger Woods sex scandal and &lt;i&gt;Steel Magnolias&lt;/i&gt;, Wilson finds heartening truths wherever he confronts death. In &lt;i&gt;Everyone Loves a Good Train Wreck&lt;/i&gt;, the perverse is never far from the sublime. The result is a powerful and delightfully provocative defense of what it means to be human--for better and for worse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
