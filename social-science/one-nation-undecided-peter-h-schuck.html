  <title>One Nation Undecided - Peter H. Schuck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s be honest, we&#39;ve all expressed opinions about difficult hot-button issues without always thinking them through. With so much media spin, political polarization, and mistrust of institutions, it&#39;s hard to know &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to think about these tough challenges, much less &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; to do about them. &lt;i&gt;One Nation Undecided&lt;/i&gt; takes on some of today&#39;s thorniest issues and walks you through each one step-by-step, explaining what makes it so difficult to grapple with and enabling you to think smartly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this unique what-to-do book, Peter Schuck tackles poverty, immigration, affirmative action, campaign finance, and religious objections to gay marriage and transgender rights. For each issue, he provides essential context; defines key concepts and values; presents the relevant empirical evidence; describes and assesses the programs that now seek to address it; and considers many plausible solutions. Schuck looks at all sides with scrupulous fairness while analyzing them rigorously and factually. Each chapter is self-contained so that readers may pick and choose among the issues that interest and concern them most. His objective is to educate rather than proselytize you&amp;#8212;the very nature of these five issues is that they resist clear answers; reasonable people can differ about where they come out on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other book provides such a comprehensive, balanced, and accessible analysis of these urgent social controversies. &lt;i&gt;One Nation Undecided&lt;/i&gt; gives you the facts and competing values, makes your thinking about them more sophisticated, and encourages you to draw your own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
