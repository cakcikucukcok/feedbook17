  <title>Superman is an Arab - Joumana Haddad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is not a manifesto against men in general. Nor is it a manifesto against Arab men in particular. It is, however, a howl in the face of a particular species of men: the macho species, Supermen, as they like to envision themselves. But Superman is a lie. In this explosive sequel to I Killed Scheherazade, Joumana Haddad examines the patriarchal system that continues to dominate in the Arab world and beyond. From monotheist religions and the concept of marriage to institutionalised machismo and widespread double standards, Haddad reflects upon the vital need for a new masculinity in these times of revolution and change in the Middle East. &#39;The revolution and its backlash are not just being fought in the streets, squares and elections across the Middle East, but also on the faces and bodies of millions of Arab women and their sisters across the world. Haddad speaks for all of us. It&#39;s time to listen.&#39; Bidisha &#39;One of the most intelligent, talented and courageous young Arab poets and intellectuals today&#39; Mahmoud Darwish &#39;The Germain Greer of Lebanon&#39; Independent." />
