  <title>Winning the War - John B. Ph.D. Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-second century historians will note that a new World War began on 9/11/2001. In reality, it began much earlier. Competing value systems and the lust for natural resources will precipitate an inevitable &lt;i&gt;clash of civilizations&lt;/i&gt;. Currently, we face elusive foes-foes who play by other rules-and in fact, we are already engaged in brutal, truly asymmetric conflict with varied forms of fighting; terrorism is but an isolated part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing number of polymorphic hostilities requires revolutionary and unconventional responses. Special operations are the norm. Nanoscale, biological, and digital technologies have transformed how we fight future wars. Tactical lasers that zap pinpoint targets at twenty kilometers are being developed, as is the millimeter-wave Active Denial System that causes intense pain to those exposed. The &quot;Mother of all Bombs&quot; has been dropped, as have thermobaric weapons that destroy caves and bunkers. Robots roam the battlefield while exotic sensors catalogue nearly every facet of our lives. Paralyzing electrical shock weapons are in the hands of police. Even &lt;i&gt;phasers on stun&lt;/i&gt; are closer than you think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Winning the War&lt;/i&gt; details the technologies and concepts necessary to ultimately determine the outcome of this global conflict. Via realistic scenarios from recovering tourists kidnapped by terrorists, to bringing down drug cartels in the Amazon, and even preventing Armageddon in the Middle East, &lt;i&gt;Winning the War&lt;/i&gt; provides an insider&#39;s view into how these futuristic weapons will be used and into the complexities of modern warfare. Bold and controversial measures are prescribed, including the essential nature of absolute domination of space. &lt;i&gt;Winning the War&lt;/i&gt; makes clear that drastic and innovative actions will be necessary to ensure our national survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
