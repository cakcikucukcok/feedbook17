  <title>How to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship - Ece Temelkuran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;’This is essential’ Margaret Atwood on Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;‘She&#39;s one of the most acute and perceptive analysts of the furtive growth of fascism. Everyone should know about this’ Philip Pullman&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;’Vibrates with outrage’ &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;‘It couldn’t happen here’&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ece Temelkuran heard reasonable people in America say it the night Trump’s election was soundtracked by chants of ‘Build that wall.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She heard reasonable people in Britain say it the night of the Brexit vote.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She heard reasonable people in Turkey say it as Erdo?an rigged elections, rebuilt the economy around cronyism, and labelled his opposition as terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Lose a Country&lt;/em&gt; is an impassioned plea, a warning to the world that populism and nationalism don’t march fully-formed into government; they creep. Award winning author and journalist Ece Temelkuran, identifies the early-warning signs of this phenomenon, sprouting up across the world from Eastern Europe to South America, in order to define a global pattern, and arm the reader with the tools to root it out.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Proposing alternative, global answers to the pressing – and too often paralysing – poltical questions of our time, Temelkuran explores the insidious idea of ‘real people’, the infantilisation of language and debate, the way laughter can prove a false friend, and the dangers of underestimating one’s opponent. She weaves memoir, history and clear-sighted argument into an urgent and eloquent defence of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No longer can the reasonable comfort themselves with ‘it couldn’t happen here.’ It is happening. And soon it may be too late.&lt;/p&gt;
