  <title>American Roma - Melanie R. Covert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;American Roma: A Modern Investigation of Lived Experiences and Media Portrayals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; explores the representation of American Roma from the nineteenth-century to today by examining portrayals in newsprint, television, movies, and social media. The lived experiences of American Roma are considered through the lens of twenty-three Roma men and women who live across the United States. Their stories highlight experiences across almost a hundred years of life in the United States and are compared with narratives collected from European Roma lives. Their narratives catalogue the extreme prejudice they have encountered in America and the struggles they have faced economically, socially, and educationally. Their narratives highlight their involvement in the civil rights movement, a history of fighting for equality under discriminatory laws, and unfair treatment by law enforcement. The role of Roma women in the fight for equality is also highlighted as readers come to understand their position at the intersection of ethnicity and gender. This book is a new look at Roma ethnicity explored from the perspective of the American Roma about American Roma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
