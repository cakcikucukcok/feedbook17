  <title>The Republican Party - Ronald Laone, Jay Laone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Ronald Laones son was eleven, he asked his father, What does it mean to be a conservative? From that simple question came a journey of political enlightenment for father and son, one that culminated in &lt;i&gt;The Republican Party&lt;/i&gt;, a history of the Republican Party, leaders, and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a comprehensive overview of the origins of the Republican Party, Laone examines the various political battles of the nineteenth century and how they shaped the partys establishment in 1854 and its core ideologies. He then profiles each Republican president from Abraham Lincoln to George W. Bush, offering a short biography and major highlights of each ones presidency.
Laone also reveals the major political firsts of the Republican Party, including the first Black US senator, the first Hispanic US congressman, and the first female US congresswoman, recording their significant contributions to the conservative movement. A comprehensive bibliography offers titles for further reading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly researched and educational, &lt;i&gt;The Republican Party&lt;/i&gt; offers information for those seeking to understand the origins of conservative thinking, values, and beliefs within the American political system.&lt;/p&gt;" />
