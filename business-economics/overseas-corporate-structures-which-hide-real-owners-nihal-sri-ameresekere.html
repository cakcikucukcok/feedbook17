  <title>Overseas  Corporate Structures, Which Hide ‘Real Owners’ - Nihal Sri Ameresekere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author brilliantly reveals with documentary evidence, extensive details of incisive investigations meticulously carried out by him, in tracing foreign assets and funds hidden in a complex structure of nominee companies, established in several foreign regimes, allegedly of a phenomenally successful, politically high-profile entrepreneur, who tragically crashes in his Lear Jet Aircraft in the Straits of Malacca. Author demonstrates the modus operandi, as to how funds and assets of politically exposed persons, forced to flee their countries, with siphoned resources of impoverished people, could be hidden under complex corporate structures, set-up by professional organizations, providing nominee Directors / nominee Shareholders, with Trust Instruments, with the real beneficial owners. This Book is invaluable in instances where political leaders / politically exposed persons are ousted from office, through mass uprisings and justifiable rebellions by people, whose resources have been pillaged and plundered, further impoverishing them. Authors investigations cover secret complex corporate structures, headquartered in Hong Kong, with visible corporates operating in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, UK, and USA, with the ultimate beneficial owners secret trusteeship traced to an Administrator in Lichtenstein, who does not dispute the name of the real beneficial owner, but requires proof of death and devolution on claimants. This is an invaluable Book to those engaged in tracing wealth stashed away in foreign regimes by politically exposed persons hounded from their countries. Author also sheds light on judicial proceedings vis-a-vis intestate estates of issueless deceased, analysing the incongruousness of legal interpretations, and classical instances of unequal treatment before the law, tainted with politically inspired conduct. This is a valuable handbook to those involved in forensic accounting, investigation and law, and to those engaged in academic, educational and real endeavours in tracing assets and funds hidden in foreign regimes - an integral component of the UN Convention Against Corruption." />
