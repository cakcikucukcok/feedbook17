Among other things, MBA programs aren&#39;t giving students the heightened cultural awareness and global perspectives they need. Newly minted MBAs lack essential leadership skills. Creative and critical thinking demand far more attention.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this compelling and authoritative new book, the authors:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183;          Document a rising chorus of concerns about business schools gleaned from extensive interviews with deans and executives, and from a detailed analysis of current curricula and emerging trends in graduate business education&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183;          Provide case studies showing how leading MBA programs have begun reinventing themselves for the better&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#183;          Offer concrete ideas for how business schools can surmount the challenges that come with reinvention, including securing faculty with new skills and experimenting with new pedagogies &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rich with examples and thoroughly researched, Rethinking the MBA reveals why and how business schools must define a better pathway for the future.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
