Napoleon Hill was best known for publishing &lt;i&gt;Think and Grow Rich&lt;/i&gt; in 1937. In it, he outlines &amp;ldquo;The Thirteen Steps to Riches,&amp;rdquo; drawn from his interviews with more than 500 wealthy men. He was originally inspired to work on the book at the encouragement of business magnate Andrew Carnegie, who at the time was one of the richest people in the world. Carnegie taught Hill a &amp;ldquo;money-making secret&amp;rdquo; that he said nearly all successful people knew. The secret had been used by the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Edison, and John D. Rockefeller to achieve their goals. Carnegie believed that the secret should be taught in public schools and could revolutionize education. &lt;i&gt;Think and Grow Rich&lt;/i&gt; was Napoleon Hill&amp;rsquo;s attempt to disclose the secret to the general public." />
