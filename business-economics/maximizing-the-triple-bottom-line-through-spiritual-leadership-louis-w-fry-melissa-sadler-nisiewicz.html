  <title>Maximizing the Triple Bottom Line Through Spiritual Leadership - Louis W. Fry, Melissa Sadler Nisiewicz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Maximizing the Triple Bottom Line through Spiritual Leadership&lt;/I&gt; draws on the emerging fields of workplace spirituality and spiritual leadership to teach leaders and their constituencies how to develop business models that address issues of ethical leadership, employee well-being, sustainability, and social responsibility without sacrificing profitability, growth, and other metrics of performance excellence.
While this text identifies and discusses the characteristics necessary to be a leader, its major focus is on &lt;I&gt;leadership&lt;/I&gt;—engaging stakeholders and enabling groups of people to work together in the most meaningful ways. The authors offer real-world examples of for-profit and non-profit organizations that have spiritual leaders and which have implemented organizational spiritual leadership. These cases are based on over ten years of research, supported by the International Institute of Spiritual Leadership, that demonstrates the value of the Spiritual Leadership Balanced Scorecard Business Model presented in the book. &quot;Pracademic&quot; in its orientation, the book presents a general process and tools for implementing the model." />
