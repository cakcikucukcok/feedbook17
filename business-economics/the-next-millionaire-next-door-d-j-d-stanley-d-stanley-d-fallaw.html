  <title>The Next Millionaire Next Door - D. J. D. Stanley, D Stanley D Fallaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span style=&quot;tab-stops:center 234pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the past 40 years, Tom Stanley and his daughter Sarah Stanley Fallaw have been involved in research examining how self-made, economically successful Americans became that way.

A new generation of household financial managers are hearing from so-called experts in personal financial management due to the proliferation of the cottage industry of financial blogs, podcasts, and the like. In many cases, these outlets are simply experiences shared without science, case studies without data based on broader populations. Therefore, the authors decided to take another look at millionaires in the United States to examine what changes could be seen 20 years after the original publication of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Millionaire Next Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In this book the authors highlight how specific decisions, behaviors, and characteristics align with the discipline of wealth building, covering areas such as consumption, budgeting, careers, investing, and financial management in general. They include results from quantitative studies of wealth as well as case studies of individuals who have been successful in building wealth. They discuss general paths to building wealth on your own, focusing specifically on careers and lifestyles associated with each path, and what it takes to be successful in each.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
