  <title>Summary: Blueprint To The Digital Economy - Don Tapscott, Alex Lowy and David Ticoll - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;BLUEPRINT TO THE DIGITAL ECONOMY: Creating Wealth in the Era of E-Business&quot; by Don Tapscott, Alex Lowy &amp;amp; David Ticoll.&lt;br&gt;In Blueprint To The Digital Economy, Tapscott, Lowy and Ticoll argue that the digital economy – computers teamed with communication networks – has the potential to transform almost every consumer and business activity. These changes are having the effect of forcing organizations to amend notions and practices about the nature of competition, the process by which wealth is created and even the nature of the firm itself.&lt;br&gt;In short, the digital economy changes every assumption ever made in business. It is also allowing completely new commercial entities – like e-business communities which use the digital economy to conduct commercial transactions and collaborate to create new wealth – to flourish and grow like never before. And it is forcing established firms to enter into partnerships and alliances with entirely different and disparate business entities.&lt;br&gt;Clearly, the digital economy opens enormous possibilities and opportunities. The challenge lies in turning the possible into the probable and then into the actual.&lt;br&gt;Blueprint To The Digital Economy is the perfect guide you need to get acquainted with the rules of the digital economy." />
