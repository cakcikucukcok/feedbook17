  <title>Stop Speculation, to Put an End to the Current Economic and Human Tragedy!! - Michael A. S. Aziz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The economic events in this book, randomly taken from the activities of the markets in the past few years, represent just a tiny tip of the iceberg of wild speculation. With the present mess in the world economies as a direct result from these senseless activities, nonstop wild speculation on the stock markets during the past four decades was sending the world straight into an economic disaster. And it happened in 2008. But what was worst is that its still going on! 	
Some of these economic events came unnoticed, at the same time with other world events that distracted us from seeing the importance of the damage they were continuously causing. But they were there in the news, with some of the most serious ones, thoroughly detailed on some websites (pointed out here), making them even more scandalous to read about. 
To surrender to the activities of the markets and think that there is no solution to this endless mess would be very wrong. The solution is simply to introduce a new economic system, like the one detailed in this booka new economic system based on the suggestions and proposals detailed here, where the rights of the workers and the youth would be restored, where the world would prosper, and where the economies would recover to the benefit of all." />
