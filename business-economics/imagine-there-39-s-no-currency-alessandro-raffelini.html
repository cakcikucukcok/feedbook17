  <title>Imagine there&#39;s no currency - Alessandro Raffelini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Imagine if twenty years ago someone had told you could video call by WhatsApp or an iPhone. Nobody would have trusted you and, perhaps, they would have thought you were crazy. Imagine just to be rewarded because you are watching a movie or an advertisement or just because you are releasing your data that can be tracked forever. Just imagine a world where there is no concentration of the control of any data under a single organization. Imagine there is no centralized currencies and no predominance of fiat money with different cryptocurrencies in your e-wallet easily to transfer with no costs. This book represents an overall analysis of the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technology and regulations with a focus on the next strategic approach to the technology and virtual money. &quot;Imagine there&#39;s no currency&quot; explains the vision of an alternative economic model and a possible evolution of the current monetary system together with technology. My conviction is that blockchain applications and cryptocurrencies will achieve a global adoption in several industries and it will be integrated into everything humans do, from payments to communication, information, commerce and much more&quot;
