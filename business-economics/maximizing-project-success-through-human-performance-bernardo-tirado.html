  <title>Maximizing Project Success Through Human Performance - Bernardo Tirado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Project management is often defined by processes and methodology, but projects are accomplished by people. Successfully leading those people is the core of a project manager&#39;s job. Even the seasoned project manager will encounter situations that present unique leadership challenges.  Bernardo Tirado offers a clear path to help develop leadership skills within the project management framework. Using a hands-on, practical approach, he presents a model for taking any project manager&#39;s leadership skills to the next level. His model focuses on techniques to develop and apply three areas of awareness-self-awareness, awareness of team dynamics, and organizational or &quot;political&quot; awareness. The first three parts of the book provide tools for understanding and influencing behavior and the last part brings the three types of awareness together in a case study.  Exercises throughout make the book interactive and offer a continual assessment of the reader&#39;s progress.
