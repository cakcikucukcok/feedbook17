  <title>Make a Difference Growth in Leadership - Dr. Larry Little, Melissa Hambrick Jackson, David Rupert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most books on leadership are penned by thought leaders and experts, each with a distinctive, individual perspective. But this work is different. Using the extensive client network of Eagle Consulting, we surveyed more than 100 leaders from all levels of experience  from CEOs to volunteer coordinators to school teachers  on how to find and nurture growth in leadership. Their collected victories and failures will sound familiar, since you probably have experienced the same in your own walk. In these pages you will find unique solutions in our common quest to make a difference.
This book challenged my thinking on leadership, it helped me understand how to be a better leader, and a better person.  You cant afford not to read this book, there is something for all real life leaders.
-Ian Poulton, Finance Manager with PPG Aerospace
&quot;There are many books on developing your leadership skills, this one is different. This book provides practical and real life stories of every day leaders at all levelsit is authentic, powerful and most of all relevant.  Required reading for all great leaders.
