  <title>Weology - Peter Aceto, Justin Kingsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada’s most engaging banker shares his strategies for operating in a radically different way in our ever-changing business world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing is average or normal at Tangerine (formerly ING Direct)—not the name, not the style of banking, not the leadership. And Peter Aceto is not your average executive. The president and CEO of Tangerine runs his business in an unorthodox and intuitively human way. The bank has no tellers, no lineups, no bricks-and-mortar branches for its customers to visit. But people are at the core of the operation: loyal, happy and engaged employees who help thousands of customers save their money, buy homes and enjoy a healthy financial life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weology&lt;/em&gt; provides an in-depth look into the “people-first” leadership strategies that have made Tangerine Canada’s leading direct bank, with more than 1.9 million clients and close to $40 billion in total assets. As the  company’s guiding hand for more than six years, Aceto thrives in his role by relying strongly on transparency, trust and accessibility. He doesn’t have a luxurious corner office (instead, he sits among the other employees), and he often responds to calls and emails from customers directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aceto’s relentless focus is on driving a type of radical thinking that delivers superior and unparalleled results for Tangerine and the financial well-being of Canadians, and that demonstrates largely how business will be led in the future. In &lt;em&gt;Weology&lt;/em&gt;, Aceto shares many stories that show how his philosophy and strategies have made him and his business so successful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
