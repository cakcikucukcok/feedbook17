  <title>Everything to know... Business is digital - Emmanuel Fraysse, Martin Pasquier, Fahim Benchouk, Alexandre Michelin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Digitization as a sustainable advantage in a connected world&lt;br/&gt;
We live in dynamic and turbulent times. Digital is everywhere and no sector has been spared – the market&lt;br/&gt;
of cultural goods, media as well as industry have all came through it. Although a bit destabilizing, this&lt;br/&gt;
phenomenon is quite fascinating and full of promises.&lt;br/&gt;
Digital barely existed 15 years ago and it is now the focus of international attention. From a business&lt;br/&gt;
point of view, the digitization is spreading while products, services, brands or sectors are partially&lt;br/&gt;
or completely transformed, taking into account the new technologies and the connected use of&lt;br/&gt;
consumption. Social web has opened new fields and more generally, the Peer2Peer approach forces&lt;br/&gt;
companies to redefine their process at every level : R&amp;D, HR, IT, Marketing, Communication, Sales...&lt;br/&gt;
Such a challenge to take up!&lt;br/&gt;
Digitization is a great opportunity to change rules and give new perspectives for any market or firm. How&lt;br/&gt;
to benefit from this social digitization? What are the new business rules? How to inform, communicate and&lt;br/&gt;
sell in the digital era while integrating mobility?&lt;br/&gt;
These are all questions that this book aims to answer with 15 years hindsight : best practices, key success&lt;br/&gt;
factors, current and future structural trends...&lt;br/&gt;
While living in 3 different continents (Europe, Asia, Middle East), the 4 authors of this book gathered their&lt;br/&gt;
expertise to give a global insight of the digitizing world :&lt;br/&gt;
• Emmanuel Fraysse (Paris)&lt;br/&gt;
• Fahim Benchouk (Abu Dhabi)&lt;br/&gt;
• Alexandre Michelin (Paris but only a week per month...)&lt;br/&gt;
• Martin Pasquier (Singapore&lt;/p&gt;" />
