Which do little or nothing? Based on the &quot;Evergreen Project,&quot; a massive, 5 year study involving the business school faculties of ten universities, the authors set out to find the management practices that truly promote long&amp;#8211;term growth and success. Their findings will revolutionize the art and practice of business management.The book shows that there are essentially six management practices that all successful companies must master simultaneously.
