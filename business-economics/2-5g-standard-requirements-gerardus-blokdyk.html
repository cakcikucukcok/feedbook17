  <title>2.5G Standard Requirements - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are accountability and ownership for 2.5G clearly defined?  What are the compelling business reasons for embarking on 2.5G?  What are the business objectives to be achieved with 2.5G?  Who will be responsible for deciding whether 2.5G goes ahead or not after the initial investigations?  How do we measure improved 2.5G service perception, and satisfaction?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make 2.5G investments work better.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
This 2.5G All-Inclusive Self-Assessment enables You to be that person.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
- implement evidence-based best practice strategies aligned with overall goals 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
- integrate recent advances in 2.5G and process design strategies into practice according to best practice guidelines
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
