  <title>The Frugal Woman&#39;s Guide to a Rich Life - Thomas Nelson, Stacia Ragolia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Frugal Woman is not cheap. She&#39;s a cost-conscious, savvy consumer who avoids wasting her time, her money, and her energy on things she does not need. She&#39;s organized about her money management, spending, and household planning. She makes decisions based on her own needs and values. She&#39;s in control of her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frugal Woman dresses her kids in brand-name clothes, gets her hair done in salons, buys antique furniture eats gourmet meals, gives gifts that wow her friends and family - and all the while socks money away in her savings and retirement account, living free of credit card debt, and feeling secure about tomorrow while enjoying today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Frugal Woman&#39;s Guide to a Rich Life&lt;/i&gt; tells how to be just such a Frugal Woman - how to make the best use of what you already have, how to identify what you really need in your life (and what you don&#39;t), how to get the necessities (and even a few luxuries) for less, and how to cut down on your and the earth&#39;s wasted resources.&lt;/p&gt;" />
