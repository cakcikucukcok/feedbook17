  <title>Following the Black Prince on the Road to Poitiers, 1355-1356 - Peter Hoskins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this guide, available in digital format for handheld devices only, Peter Hoskins takes the tourist along the routes of the Black Prince&#39;s expedition to France in 1355 and 1356. He draws on his on-the-ground experience of walking more than 1,300 miles across France, retracing the routes of the armies in search of a greater understanding of the Black Prince&#39;s expedition. He tells the story of theraids from Bordeaux to the Mediterranean and north to the Loire which culminated in the Black Prince&#39;s victory at the Battle of Poitiers, and provides detailed information to allow the tourist to follow the routes by car, on foot or by bike. The sixteen tours each have a map, details of sites of historic interest, and GPS co-ordinates, with further practical information to help tourists plan their visit; they cater for motorists, walkers and cyclists alike. This guide is available from a range of e-book suppliers but not directly from Boydell &amp; Brewer. PETER HOSKINS combines his interest in exploration of his adopted country, France, with his research into the Hundred Years War. His book, In the Steps of the Black Prince: The Road to Poitiers, 1355-1356 was published in 2011; this volume forms a companion to it." />
