  <title>Summary: 2020 Vision - Stan Davis and Bill Davidson - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;2020 VISION: Transform your business today to succeed in tomorrow’s economy&quot; by Stan Davis and Bill Davidson.&lt;br&gt;&quot;By the year 2020, the way everyone lives and makes a living will be totally transformed by information technology and biotechnology&quot;. &lt;br&gt;Companies are under pressure to constantly update themselves and their products to keep up with adjustments in technology. Over the next 30 years the challenges that face today’s businesses will be so dramatic that they will have to make extremely creative and bold changes to keep ahead of their competition. Information technology is evolving at an astonishing rate and a company’s competitive advantage is far more important than its age. &lt;br&gt;This summary helps you to take a critical look at your company and identify ways to create a sustainable infrastructure for growth and survival. Its authors believe that we are currently in the Information Age, which followed the Industrial Age. However, they believe that this information economy is swiftly moving towards a bio-economy in which mind-like computers, genetic engineering and miniaturization will have a huge impact on the business that exist today. 2020 Vision is a revolutionary read, logically laid out and filled with persuasive facts, examples and references." />
