  <title>How to Get Enrich out of the Debt Cycle - Hennie Reynders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to manage money is probably something you need to learn from your parents, the same way they taught you proper manners. Unfortunately, it is often in those early days of ones upbringing that things start going wrong. Parents want to give their children nothing but the best and will go to extremes to give their children what they ask, even if they know this is a waste of money.
Having money often turns into a matter of competition. If I have more money than you, then I am in a much better position than you. In fact, I may even be a much better person. The idea that money makes you a quality person is as totally wrong as it is common; the amount of money in your purse or your bank balance definitely does not determine your integrity or character." />
