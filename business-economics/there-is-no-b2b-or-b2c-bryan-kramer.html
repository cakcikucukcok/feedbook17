  <title>There is No B2B or B2C - Bryan Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As marketers, we&amp;rsquo;ve been trained to speak &amp;ldquo;business to business&amp;rdquo; (B2B) or &amp;ldquo;business to consumer&amp;rdquo; (B2C). But instead of this creating a simple framework for dialogue between humans, it set forth an unnatural language for marketers, using words like &amp;ldquo;synergy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;speeds and feeds&amp;rdquo; to tell the stories of products and services to their buyers and partners. The fact is that businesses do not have emotion. Products do not have emotion. Humans do. Humans want to feel something. And humans make mistakes. In Human to Human #H2H, Bryan explores the many facets of why and how communication today needs to be adjusted to keep up with our ever-evolving and fast moving social and digital world. Through anecdotes from his own experiences as president of a Silicon Valley marketing firm, he both inspires new ways of finding commonality in our humanity, but also practical tools to think like a human marketer again. Specifically, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn: &amp;bull; The Four Rules of Social Context &amp;bull; How Human Sensory Building will make you a better Marketer &amp;bull; The Secrets to Making Ideas Crowd Worthy, with real world examples &amp;bull; How to be &amp;ldquo;Delightfully Disruptive&amp;rdquo; &amp;bull; Insights into building a Social Business &amp;bull; What it means to have a &amp;ldquo;Focker Moment&amp;rdquo; and why they should be celebrated Embedded are short intimate video conversations with some of today&amp;rsquo;s most forward-thinking humans; Jonathan Becher, CMO at SAP, Charlene Li, author and co-founder of The Altimeter Group, and Kare&amp;acute;Anderson, Emmy Award-winning journalist and founder of the Say It Better Center. If you&amp;#39;re looking to bring back the human side of communication, in all its imperfection, empathy, and simplicity, Human to Human #H2H is for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
