  <title>The Science of Management - Simon Moss, Ronald Francis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the performance of their employees, managers need to reach an extraordinary number of decisions every day based on information and training as well as on their experience and instinct for what is right. But are the assumptions and beliefs behind theses decisions always based on real evidence&amp;#160; or do many follow instead the latest management fad, personal opinion, anecdotal observation, pseudo-research or just a dogged preference for the status quo? The authors of The Science of Management: Fighting Fads and Fallacies with Evidence-Based Practices have collated and analysed almost 16,000 scientific research articles in the fields of psychology and management to uncover over 800 surprising findings that contradict many common management practices. This book presents some of these key discoveries organised around the core management responsibilities of:&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&amp;bull; workplace objectives&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&amp;bull; team performance&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&amp;bull; individual performance&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&amp;bull; addressing undesirable behaviour&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&amp;bull; promoting employee wellbeing&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&amp;bull; recruitment and selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting and redressing these fallacies, the authors offer the reader the opportunity to challenge many sources of bias that contaminate our beliefs and opinions and provoke unsuitable decisions at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great read for all those involved in management and supervision, from student to experienced practitioner level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
