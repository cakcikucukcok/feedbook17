  <title>The Genius Is Inside. - Michel David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A HIGH PERFORMANCE STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR MID-TIER COMPANIES
Luck is not enough.  You can create your future with radical thinking and a high performance process.
Good processes will produce predictable results in terms of quality, innovation, performance and strategy.  Superior processes will raise the bar even higher.  Poor processes will reduce results significantly. 
The strategic processes currently available to small and medium sized businesses were designed for large corporations.  They are driven by intense analytics.  Their goal is to protect and optimize what already exists.  This does not match the needs or the resources of mid-tier companies.  
This book proposes a high performance strategic planning process for small and mid-sized firms. It starts from the premise that 60 to 80% of the information required to formulate strategy is already present inside the organizaation.  Generally, that is sufficent. 
The challenge is to design a process and develop specific tools or methodologies that are aligned to this approach for mid-tier comanies.  Such tools, validated by solid field experience, are presented in the book as well as the culture and the mindset that are required to apply them successfully." />
