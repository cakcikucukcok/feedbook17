  <title>Summary: Treasure Hunt - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The must-read summary of Michael Silverstein&#39;s book: &quot;Treasure Hunt: Inside the Mind of the New Consumer&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This complete summary of the ideas from Michael Silverstein&#39;s book &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; shows how middle-class consumers now have far more tools available to help them make decisions about the products and services they choose to buy. Many are embarking on a personal “treasure hunt” to come up with just the right combination of products and services to fit their needs and preferences like a glove. In his book, the author also explains that another phenomenon is the fact that consumers are trading up and are willing to pay a premium for high-quality products and services which are emotionally rich for them. To fund those purchases, consumers are also relentlessly trading down in other categories. This summary demonstrates that the challenge for every business is to find practical ways to align their products and services with either the trading-up or trading-down trends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added-value of this summary:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;• Save time&lt;br&gt;• Understand key concepts&lt;br&gt;• Expand your knowledge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To learn more, read &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; and find out what challenges your business faces in the 21st century and how to deal with them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
