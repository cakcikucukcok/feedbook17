  <title>Summary: The Art of the Start - Guy Kawasaki - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;THE ART OF THE START: The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting Anything&quot; by Guy Kawasaki.&lt;br&gt;Guy Kawasaki is the managing director of Garage Technology Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm which assists high-technology companies. Previously, he worked for Apple Computer, Inc. as a software evangelist for the Macintosh and later as an Apple Fellow. &lt;br&gt;Starting a business is much more of an art than a step-by-step or a thoroughly predictable process. According to Kawasaki, success in taking an idea and building it into a new business is actually the cumulative result of eleven distinct arts such as the Art of Positioning, the Art of Writing a Business Plan and the Art of Rainmaking. As the author argues in The Art of the Start, to succeed in getting a new business off the ground, you’d better be able to bring all these arts to bear or it’s going to be an uphill struggle. &lt;br&gt;The Art of the Start is a great book about entrepreneurship. Kawasaki reveals everything you need to know about building a meaningful organization." />
