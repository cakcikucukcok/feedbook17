  <title>Long Property - Daniel Gold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you’re looking to double your money in six months, or if you want ten properties in ten weeks, then you may as well stop reading now.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Successful homebuyers and property investors understand that property is a long-term investment. They follow proven systems for buying assets that will appreciate in value, and they set up loan structures sensibly and correctly to support this.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Strategic investors have plans. They set goals like:&lt;br /&gt;
- I want to own my home outright (with no debt); and&lt;br /&gt;
- I want to retire with $120,000 per annum passive income from investments&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then they work with a team of specialists (finance brokers, buyers advocates, accountants, solicitors) to make educated decisions, and to execute accordingly.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In LONG PROPERTY, top finance broker Daniel Gold sets out a strategic wealth plan towards home ownership and retirement. It’s the exact opposite to what (unfortunately) dominates the residential property and finance industries - no plan, no strategy - just getting a cheap interest rate, and buying sub-optimal properties.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this educational new book you will discover:&lt;br /&gt;
- Why the outlook for well located residential property in Australia is remarkably positive&lt;br /&gt;
- How your retirement objectives can be met via a strategic long-term investment journey&lt;br /&gt;
- How to navigate today’s banking system and utilise advanced finance structures for wealth creation&lt;br /&gt;
- How strategic investors use the ‘GLOW’ model to buy the tiny percentage of properties (maybe 2%) actually worth buying, and how they don’t overpay – case studies included; and&lt;br /&gt;
- How working with specialists could easily save you or make you hundreds of thousands of dollars
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
LONG PROPERTY is the book you wish you read in your 20&#39;s. It will help you know where you’re heading, so you can start making smarter property and finance decisions today." />
