  <title>The Claims Game: The Tricks and Deceptive Tactics Insurance Companies Use to Underpay or Deny Your Claim - David Skipton, Pcla, Lpcs, Sppa, Aic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When someone suffers a serious loss at their home or business, one of the first things they often think is this: &quot;At least I have insurance.&quot;   But the claims process is deviously designed to pay only pennies on the dollar for losses. Furthermore, if you take an insurance company to court, you&#39;ll find that the legal system is stacked against you.   David Skipton brings his many years of claims adjusting experience to help you avoid the pitfalls in the claims process. Learn how to:  recognize the tricks insurance companies play to cheat you out of money;  take steps to improve your chances of enjoying a favorable outcome on a claim; and  receive fair compensation in the event of an insurance payout.   It doesn&#39;t matter if you own a business or a home-if you have an active claim or not-it&#39;s important to demystify the claims process. It begins by learning how to protect your best interests and learning how to play The Claims Game." />
