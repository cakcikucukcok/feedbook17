  <title>Energy Crisis in India - Dr Shree Raman Dubey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am presenting this study on behalf of the millions and millions of citizens of India who eagerly are waiting to witness the transition from darkness to lightness. Many more cyber cities are the dreams of Indians.
Politics Vs Economics , is the prime mover for any national development in the World. I believe every stakeholder is contributing to develop and sustain the Indian Power Sector within the limitations and restrictions of scope and availability. 
Policy, regulation, legislation , controls, monitoring, implementation, projects, institutions, structures, frameworks, services, finances, revenues, losses, profits, and so on are struggling to excel with infinite permutations and combinations.  
Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) in India is not to be neglected in core sectors. R&amp;D is a continual tool towards betterment of the complete supply chain of electricity supply. Ministry of New &amp; Renewable Energy is taking initiatives to conduct solar training programmes. 
Power Consumption Vs Power Conservation, the  balance can be made only by awareness , education and training programmes throughout the World. 
Energy is always a Global issue.
Will Green Energy dominate the Power Sector in India?
I believe, Learning by criticism brings in excellence. We all should thank this type of debate, discussions, brainstorming and analysis . It brings out innovations and refinement in thinking and decision making.
The perception of constructive criticism should be to find avenues for strengthening the Indian Power System. 
I am grateful to all the analysts in the energy and power sector who have sacrificed their valuable time in researching and innovating better ways of improving the power systems in the world.
I am equally indebted to the great scientists , educationists and  reformists who have lived their lives to light the world.
I am obliged to understand their pain in transforming the darkness of the world into lightness forever. 
I hope every reader should participate in saving electrical energy . 
This book, Energy Crisis in India, is a drive to alleviate the energy crisis. I sincerely request my readers and their associates to join me and the nation in saving energy .
Finally from the bottom of my heart we will all remain indebted to the , People who Power the World.." />
