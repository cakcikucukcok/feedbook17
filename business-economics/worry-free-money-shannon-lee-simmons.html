  <title>Worry-Free Money - Shannon Lee Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NATIONAL BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A fresh way to think about your money.&quot; David Chilton, author of &lt;em&gt;The Wealthy Barber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop budgeting. Start living. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing your money can be frustrating and confusing. Life is expensive. Whether you make $30,000 or $130,000 a year, it can feel like you&amp;#8217;re constantly broke. Can you afford that new car, that vacation, that night out? You think so, but it feels impossible to know. And rigid budgets that force you to spend your money in unrealistic ways (like $9.50 per week for pants) don&amp;#8217;t make things any clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if there was a new way to manage your money? One that left you certain you had your bases covered&amp;#8212;both for your monthly bills and your future retirement&amp;#8212;and then let you &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; your money by spending it. (Yes, really.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Shannon Lee Simmons, a fresh voice in the world of personal finance, one who understands the new and very real pressures to survive modern life and keep up in the age of social media. Shannon doesn&amp;#8217;t lecture, judge or patronize. The founder of the wildly popular New School of Finance, Shannon recognized that most of her thousands of financial planning clients felt broke, no matter what their income. And feeling broke can be as bad as actually being broke, because it leads to overspending and misery. So she came up with a new plan: &lt;em&gt;Worry-Free Money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worry-Free Money&lt;/em&gt; takes a fresh approach to finances, looking at the root cause of the pressure to spend and showing why traditional budgets don&amp;#8217;t work. It is a deeply practical book that will help you break the cycle of guilt, understand why you overspend, banish unhappy spending from your life, learn to recognize your f*ck it moments and find hope&amp;#8212;and fun&amp;#8212;in getting your money under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
